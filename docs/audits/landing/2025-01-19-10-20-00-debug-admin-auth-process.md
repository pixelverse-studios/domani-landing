# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-19 10:20:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested a debug process for admin login issues. Still getting 401 errors and redirects to /admin/unauthorized.

## Actions Taken
1. Added comprehensive debug logging to Google OAuth callback
2. Added debug logging to email allowlist checker
3. Fixed middleware redirect loop by excluding /admin/unauthorized
4. Created debug guide documentation
5. Prepared system for debugging session

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/admin/auth/google/callback/route.ts` - Added debug logging throughout OAuth flow
- `src/lib/admin/config.ts` - Added debug logging for email allowlist checking
- `src/lib/admin/middleware.ts` - Fixed redirect loop for unauthorized page
- `DEBUG_ADMIN_LOGIN.md` - Created comprehensive debug guide

## Components/Features Affected
- Google OAuth authentication flow
- Admin email allowlist validation
- Admin middleware routing
- Debug logging system

## Testing Considerations
- Monitor terminal output during login attempts
- Check exact email returned by Google
- Verify admin_users table has correct entries
- Ensure email matches allowlist exactly

## Performance Impact
- None in production (debug logs only)
- Minimal overhead from console.log statements
- Can be removed after debugging complete

## Next Steps
1. User should attempt login while monitoring terminal
2. Share debug output to identify exact failure point
3. Fix specific issue based on debug results
4. Remove debug logging after resolution

## Notes
**Debug Process:**
1. Debug logs will show exact email from Google
2. Will show if email is in allowlist
3. Will show admin_users table query results
4. Will identify exactly where authentication fails

**Common Issues to Check:**
- Email case sensitivity
- Missing admin_users table entry
- User not active in admin_users
- Email mismatch between Google and allowlist

**Middleware Fix:**
Fixed redirect loop where /admin/unauthorized was being redirected to /admin/login because it required authentication. Now both /admin/login and /admin/unauthorized are excluded from auth checks.

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-19 17:00:00

## Prompt Summary
Fix audit log errors showing "invalid input value for enum audit_action: 'read'" when accessing admin endpoints.

## Actions Taken
1. **Identified the Issue**
   - The middleware was trying to log 'read' as an audit action
   - The database enum `audit_action` didn't include 'read' value
   - TypeScript `AdminAction` enum had 'read' but `AuditAction` enum didn't

2. **Created Migration**
   - Created `20250119_add_read_audit_action.sql` to add 'read' to enum
   - Created `apply_read_enum_fix.sql` for direct database application

3. **Updated TypeScript Types**
   - Added `Read = 'read'` to `AuditAction` enum in `src/types/admin.ts`
   - Ensured consistency between TypeScript and database schema

## Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/20250119_add_read_audit_action.sql` - New migration
- `apply_read_enum_fix.sql` - Direct SQL fix script
- `src/types/admin.ts` - Updated AuditAction enum

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin audit logging system
- All admin API endpoints that log read actions
- Waitlist management page
- Dashboard data fetching

## Testing Considerations
- Access `/admin/waitlist` and verify no errors
- Check audit logs table for proper 'read' entries
- Ensure all admin endpoints log correctly

## Performance Impact
- None - only adds an enum value
- Audit logs will now properly track read operations

## Next Steps
1. **Apply the migration to Supabase**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
   - Paste contents of `apply_read_enum_fix.sql`
   - Execute the query

2. **Verify the fix**:
   - Access `/admin/waitlist`
   - Check console for no audit log errors
   - Query audit logs to see 'read' actions

## Notes
- The error occurred because middleware was logging all successful API calls as 'read' actions
- Read access tracking is important for security auditing
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing audit logs
- Migration is idempotent - safe to run multiple times

## SQL to Apply
```sql
-- Add 'read' to audit_action enum
ALTER TYPE audit_action ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'read';
```

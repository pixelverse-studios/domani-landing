# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:38:07

## Prompt Summary
Added home-page style motion animations to the About page content.

## Actions Taken
1. Extracted About page body into a new client-side `AboutContent` component using Framer Motion.
2. Introduced staggered fade-in animations for hero copy, sections, values grid, and CTA.
3. Wired the server `/about` page to render the animated component while preserving metadata.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Replaced inline markup with animated `AboutContent`.
- `src/components/about/AboutContent.tsx` - New client component implementing motion variants.

## Components/Features Affected
- About page layout and presentation

## Testing Considerations
- Verify all sections animate smoothly when scrolled into view on desktop and mobile.
- Confirm no hydration warnings occur on `/about`.
- Ensure buttons and links remain focusable post-animation.

## Performance Impact
- Slightly higher bundle size due to Framer Motion usage, consistent with other marketing sections.

## Next Steps
- Optionally share animation helpers between pages if additional marketing sections need motion.

## Notes
- Animation timings mirror hero section patterns on the homepage for visual continuity.

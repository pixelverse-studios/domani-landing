# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-21 13:15:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported that the firstName field was showing "Early Adopter" for records in the admin waitlist page, indicating incorrect data where the referral type was stored in the name field instead of the proper referral_type field.

## Actions Taken
1. Created migration to move incorrectly stored referral types from name field to referral_type field
2. Set name to NULL for affected records since "Early Adopter" is not a real person's name
3. Verified admin interface handles NULL names gracefully
4. Verified CSV export handles empty names properly

## Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/20250121_fix_early_adopter_names.sql` - Created migration to fix data import issue

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)
- `src/app/admin/waitlist/page.tsx` - Already handles empty names with fallback to "-"
- `src/app/api/admin/waitlist/export/route.ts` - Already handles empty names with empty string

## Components/Features Affected
- Waitlist data integrity
- Admin waitlist display
- CSV export functionality

## Data Migration Details
The migration will update records where:
- `name = 'Early Adopter'` → `referral_type = 'early_adopter', name = NULL`
- `name = 'Friends & Family'` → `referral_type = 'friends_family', name = NULL`
- `name = 'Beta Tester'` → `referral_type = 'beta_tester', name = NULL`
- `name = 'VIP'` → `referral_type = 'vip', name = NULL`

Only updates records where referral_type is 'website' or NULL to avoid overwriting correct data.

## Testing Considerations
- Verify affected records show correct referral_type after migration
- Confirm firstName displays as "-" in admin for records with NULL names
- Test CSV export includes empty string for missing names
- Ensure no data loss during migration

## Performance Impact
- One-time data update operation
- No ongoing performance impact
- No changes to application code

## Migration Instructions
Run this migration AFTER the previous two migrations:

### Order of migrations:
1. `20250121_add_status_to_waitlist.sql` (first)
2. `20250121_rename_source_to_referral_type.sql` (second)
3. `20250121_fix_early_adopter_names.sql` (third - this one)

### Commands:
```bash
# Local development
npx supabase migration up

# Production
npx supabase db push

# Or run directly in Supabase SQL Editor
```

## Next Steps
- Consider adding validation to prevent referral types being entered as names
- May want to add a data import validation layer
- Consider requiring actual names for future signups

## Notes
- This fixes a data import issue where referral type labels were incorrectly stored as user names
- Admin interface already gracefully handles NULL names
- No code changes required, only data cleanup

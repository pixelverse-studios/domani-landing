## Prompt Summary
Resolved TypeScript easing errors after adding motion variants to marketing components.

## Actions Taken
1. Updated Framer Motion variant definitions in About, Pricing, and FAQ content components to use typed `'easeOut' as const`.
2. Ensured consistent easing configuration across all marketing animations to satisfy `Transition` typings.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/about/AboutContent.tsx` - Added literal assertion for easing value.
- `src/components/pricing/PricingContent.tsx` - Same easing fix for pricing animations.
- `src/components/faq/FAQContent.tsx` - Fixed easing type and aligned with others.

## Components/Features Affected
- About, Pricing, and FAQ animations

## Testing Considerations
- Rebuild TypeScript to confirm errors cleared.
- Verify animations still play with expected timing.

## Performance Impact
- None

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Keeps motion variants type-safe while preserving behavior.

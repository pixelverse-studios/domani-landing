## Prompt Summary
Fixed client component serialization error on About page caused by passing icon functions from a server component.

## Actions Taken
1. Updated `/about` page to pass icon identifiers instead of component functions into the client `AboutContent`.
2. Added an icon lookup map within `AboutContent` so the client component selects the correct Lucide icon locally.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Switched value definitions to use string icon keys.
- `src/components/about/AboutContent.tsx` - Introduced icon map and typings for safe client-side rendering.

## Components/Features Affected
- About page values section

## Testing Considerations
- Reload `/about` to confirm the serialization error no longer occurs.
- Ensure all icon cards still render with correct symbols and animations.

## Performance Impact
- None

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Aligns with Next.js requirement that server components only pass serializable data to client components.

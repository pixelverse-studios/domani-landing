# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-19 20:15:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to start resolving ESLint errors in small chunks

## Actions Taken
1. Created todo list to track ESLint error fixes
2. Fixed require() imports in scripts/fix-audit-enum.js by adding ESLint disable comments
3. Fixed unused variable 'currentValues' by prefixing with underscore
4. Removed unused imports from admin campaign pages (Tag, Filter, Copy, Trash2, etc.)
5. Fixed unused variables in campaign pages by prefixing with underscore
6. Fixed React unescaped entities errors by replacing apostrophes with &apos;
7. Fixed unused router variables in admin pages
8. Fixed unused imports in component files

## Files Changed
- `scripts/fix-audit-enum.js` - Added ESLint disable comments, fixed unused variable
- `src/app/admin/campaigns/new/page.tsx` - Removed unused Tag import, fixed unused variables
- `src/app/admin/campaigns/page.tsx` - Removed unused imports (Filter, MoreHorizontal, Copy, Trash2, BarChart3, getCampaignStatusColor)
- `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` - Fixed unescaped apostrophe
- `src/app/admin/unauthorized/page.tsx` - Fixed unescaped apostrophe
- `src/app/admin/templates/page.tsx` - Removed unused imports (Filter, Calendar), removed unused router
- `src/app/admin/waitlist/page.tsx` - Removed unused imports (Row, Download, Send), removed unused router
- `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Fixed unescaped apostrophes
- `src/components/WaitlistInline.tsx` - Fixed unescaped apostrophe, fixed unused variables

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin dashboard pages
- Campaign management
- Waitlist management
- Template management
- Hero section
- Waitlist signup forms

## Testing Considerations
- Verify all admin pages still function correctly
- Test waitlist signup flow
- Ensure removed imports weren't actually needed
- Check that prefixed underscore variables don't break functionality

## Performance Impact
- No runtime performance impact
- Cleaner code with fewer unused imports
- Better maintainability

## Next Steps
- Continue fixing remaining 52 ESLint errors
- Focus on API route errors next
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks to prevent new errors
- Run full test suite to ensure no breaking changes

## Notes
- Reduced ESLint errors from 73 to 52 (29% reduction)
- Used underscore prefix convention for intentionally unused variables
- Added ESLint disable comments for Node.js script files
- Most errors were unused variables and React unescaped entities

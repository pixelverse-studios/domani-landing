# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:04:23

## Prompt Summary
Adjusted header navigation to match site aesthetic with hover transitions and active styling.

## Actions Taken
1. Imported `usePathname` to determine active routes in the header navigation.
2. Created a reusable `NavLink` component with gradient underline hover/active states.
3. Applied consistent styling for both desktop and mobile navigation lists.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added active-state logic, Tailwind transitions, and gradient underline styling for navigation links.

## Components/Features Affected
- Header navigation

## Testing Considerations
- Confirm active link styling updates when navigating between `/about`, `/pricing`, and `/faq`.
- Ensure underline hover animation behaves smoothly on touch devices (no flicker).

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; additional styling helpers only.

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Uses `cn` helper for cleaner class merging and maintains responsive layout.

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:09:25

## Prompt Summary
Applied the updated navigation header across all marketing pages instead of limiting it to the homepage.

## Actions Taken
1. Imported `Header` into `/about`, `/pricing`, and `/faq` pages.
2. Wrapped page content with `<Header />` and a padded `<main>` to account for the fixed nav height.
3. Aligned layout spacing and indentation to match existing design system conventions.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Added header, adjusted layout wrappers and spacing for content sections.
- `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` - Introduced header and normalized container spacing beneath navigation.
- `src/app/faq/page.tsx` - Inserted header, updated gradient wrapper, and ensured CTA section alignment.

## Components/Features Affected
- Marketing page layouts (About, Pricing, FAQ)
- Global navigation visibility

## Testing Considerations
- Visually verify that each page renders beneath the fixed header without overlap.
- Check responsive breakpoints to ensure header and content spacing remain consistent.

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; reuses existing `Header` component without additional logic.

## Next Steps
- Consider abstracting a shared marketing layout if more pages need the same structure.

## Notes
- Maintains consistent navigation experience across marketing routes while keeping admin dashboard unaffected.

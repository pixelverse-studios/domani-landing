## Prompt Summary
Updated FAQ accordion so each question animates independently instead of all entries appearing at once.

## Actions Taken
1. Added Framer Motion variants to `FAQAccordion`, including per-category fade and per-item slide-in timing.
2. Refactored `FAQItem` to use motion wrappers with custom delays tied to list index.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/faq/FAQAccordion.tsx` - Integrated motion imports, variants, and per-item animations.

## Components/Features Affected
- FAQ accordion interaction

## Testing Considerations
- Scroll through `/faq` to confirm staggered animation of entries and accordion toggles still operate correctly.
- Validate no hydration or TypeScript warnings appear.

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; leverages existing Framer Motion dependency.

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Animation timings align with other marketing sections for consistent feel.

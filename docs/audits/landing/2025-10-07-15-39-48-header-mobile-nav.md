## Prompt Summary
Implemented a mobile-responsive navigation drawer for the shared header.

## Actions Taken
1. Added hamburger toggle with Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` to reveal a mobile menu panel.
2. Ensured nav links close the drawer on navigation and disabled underline styling for the panel.
3. Kept desktop layout right-aligned while introducing responsive grid/container updates.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added stateful mobile menu, updated nav link helper, and refined layout classes.

## Components/Features Affected
- Global header (mobile & desktop)

## Testing Considerations
- Test on narrow screens to confirm the drawer opens/closes smoothly and focus management works.
- Confirm desktop layout unchanged aside from previous right alignment.

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; leverages existing Framer Motion dependency.

## Next Steps
- Optionally lock body scroll when the drawer is open if future UX needs demand it.

## Notes
- Drawer auto-closes on route change via pathname effect.

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-21 16:00:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported an endless re-render loop in the AdminSidebar component, evidenced by console.log being hit repeatedly.

## Actions Taken
1. Investigated the re-render loop by examining AdminSidebar and related components
2. Identified the root causes:
   - Functions (hasRole, hasPermission) being used as useEffect dependencies without memoization
   - Aggressive refetch settings in useQuery (refetchOnMount: 'always', refetchOnWindowFocus: true)
3. Fixed the issues:
   - Wrapped hasRole and hasPermission functions in useCallback hooks
   - Changed refetchOnMount from 'always' to false
   - Changed refetchOnWindowFocus from true to false
   - Kept refetchOnReconnect as true for network recovery
4. Removed debug console.log from AdminSidebar

## Files Changed
- `src/hooks/useAdminUser.ts` - Added useCallback for memoization, adjusted refetch settings
- `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Removed debug console.log

## Components/Features Affected
- AdminSidebar component
- useAdminUser hook
- useAdminAuth hook
- Admin authentication flow

## Testing Considerations
- Verify that the re-render loop is resolved
- Check that user data still loads correctly on initial mount
- Test that logout functionality still works
- Ensure role and permission checks still function properly
- Monitor performance in React DevTools Profiler
- Test reconnection scenarios to ensure data refreshes

## Performance Impact
- Significant performance improvement by eliminating re-render loop
- Reduced unnecessary API calls for user verification
- Better memory usage with memoized functions
- More predictable component behavior

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing a manual refresh button if users need to force-refresh their session
- Could add a periodic session check (e.g., every 5 minutes) instead of on every window focus
- Monitor for any authentication edge cases

## Notes
The re-render loop was caused by:
1. Non-memoized functions as useEffect dependencies causing the effect to re-run
2. Overly aggressive refetch settings causing continuous data fetching
3. Multiple components using the same auth hook creating cascading updates

The fix ensures stable references for functions and more reasonable refetch behavior while maintaining security and session validity.

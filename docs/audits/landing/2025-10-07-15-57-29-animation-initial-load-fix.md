# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 15:57:29

## Prompt Summary
Fixed an issue where About, Pricing, and FAQ pages sometimes rendered only the hero section until a hard refresh.

## Actions Taken
1. Replaced `whileInView` triggers with direct `animate="visible"` on key layout containers so content animates immediately on navigation.
2. Wrapped gradient headings in spans (previous change) and ensured Framer Motion sections default to visible states without relying on intersection observers.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/about/AboutContent.tsx` - Simplified motion triggers to use immediate animation.
- `src/components/pricing/PricingContent.tsx` - Same adjustment for pricing cards, FAQ, and trust blocks.
- `src/components/faq/FAQContent.tsx` - Applied consistent animation pattern for accordion and CTA.

## Components/Features Affected
- About, Pricing, and FAQ page animations

## Testing Considerations
- Navigate between pages without full reload to confirm all sections appear.
- Ensure scroll-based animations still feel smooth (now triggered on mount).

## Performance Impact
- Slightly reduced intersection observers; negligible runtime impact.

## Next Steps
- If scroll-triggered effects are needed later, re-introduce with explicit `IntersectionObserver`.

## Notes
- Resolves blank-state rendering during client-side navigation.

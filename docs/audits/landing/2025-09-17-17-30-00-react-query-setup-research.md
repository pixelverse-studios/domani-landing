## Prompt Summary
User requested research on React Query (TanStack Query) best practices for Next.js 14 applications, specifically focusing on:
1. QueryClient configuration best practices
2. Modern approaches to provider setup in Next.js App Router
3. React Query DevTools integration for development
4. Optimal default options for caching and refetching
5. Error handling strategies for production admin dashboard

## Actions Taken
1. Conducted comprehensive web search for React Query + Next.js 14 App Router best practices
2. Researched DevTools integration and production error handling strategies
3. Investigated advanced error handling with retry configuration and global error boundaries
4. Analyzed caching strategies including staleTime, gcTime, and refetching patterns
5. Compiled production-ready implementation recommendations

## Research Findings Summary

### QueryClient Configuration Best Practices
- Avoid useState for QueryClient initialization in SSR environments
- Use singleton pattern with server/client separation for Next.js App Router
- Configure appropriate default staleTime for SSR (60+ seconds)
- Never create QueryClient at file root level (security/performance risk)

### Provider Setup Patterns
- Create 'use client' provider component for QueryClientProvider
- Implement makeQueryClient() function with proper server/client handling
- Use HydrationBoundary for server-side data prefetching
- Include ReactQueryDevtools only in development builds

### Error Handling Strategies
- Implement global error callbacks via QueryCache
- Use throwOnError for Error Boundary integration
- Configure retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Set up granular error boundaries for different app sections

### Caching and Refetching Optimization
- staleTime: Controls when data becomes stale (0 by default)
- gcTime: Controls memory cleanup (5 minutes by default)
- Disable refetchOnWindowFocus for admin dashboards
- Use refetchInterval for real-time data updates

## Components/Features Affected
- Not applicable - this is research for future implementation

## Testing Considerations
- Test SSR hydration with dehydrated state
- Verify error boundary fallbacks work correctly
- Test retry mechanisms with network failures
- Validate caching behavior across page navigations

## Performance Impact
- Proper QueryClient setup prevents memory leaks
- Optimized staleTime reduces unnecessary network requests
- Error boundaries prevent cascade failures
- Appropriate gcTime manages memory consumption

## Next Steps
- Implement QueryClient configuration with recommended defaults
- Set up provider hierarchy with DevTools integration
- Configure error handling strategy with monitoring
- Establish caching policies for different data types

## Notes
- Research conducted for production admin dashboard implementation
- All recommendations based on 2024/2025 best practices
- Focus on Next.js 14 App Router compatibility
- Emphasis on production reliability and performance

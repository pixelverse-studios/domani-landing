# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:25:41

## Prompt Summary
Resolved server component error by moving FAQ accordion state into a client-side subcomponent.

## Actions Taken
1. Created `FAQAccordion` client component that handles toggle state and transitions.
2. Updated `/faq` page to import the new component so the server-rendered page no longer uses React state directly.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/faq/FAQAccordion.tsx` - New client component encapsulating FAQ item animations.
- `src/app/faq/page.tsx` - Removed client hooks, wired in `FAQAccordion`.

## Components/Features Affected
- FAQ page accordion interactions

## Testing Considerations
- Ensure FAQ page loads without server errors.
- Verify expand/collapse behavior still animates correctly on all FAQs.

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; state is scoped per FAQ item in the client component.

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Keeps `/faq` as a server component while preserving UX improvements.

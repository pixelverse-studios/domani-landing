# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-19 19:45:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to set up Prettier and ESLint for the project

## Actions Taken
1. Checked existing configuration files and package.json for current setup
2. Created ESLint configuration file with Next.js, TypeScript, and React best practices
3. Created Prettier configuration file with consistent formatting rules
4. Created ignore files for both ESLint and Prettier
5. Added npm scripts for linting, formatting, and type checking
6. Created .editorconfig file for consistent editor settings
7. Attempted to install dependencies (failed due to npm permission issues)

## Files Changed
- `.eslintrc.json` - Created comprehensive ESLint configuration with Next.js, TypeScript, React hooks, JSX accessibility, and import order rules
- `.prettierrc.json` - Created Prettier configuration with project-specific formatting rules
- `.prettierignore` - Created ignore file for Prettier to skip generated/build files
- `.eslintignore` - Created ignore file for ESLint to skip build and generated files
- `package.json` - Added scripts for lint:fix, format, format:check, type-check, and check-all
- `.editorconfig` - Created EditorConfig file for consistent coding styles across editors

## Components/Features Affected
- Development workflow
- Code quality tooling
- CI/CD pipeline (when integrated)
- Developer experience

## Testing Considerations
- Need to install dependencies before testing can occur
- Should test linting on existing TypeScript/TSX files
- Should test formatting on various file types
- Should verify ESLint-Prettier integration works without conflicts
- Should test all new npm scripts

## Performance Impact
- No runtime performance impact
- Development build times may slightly increase due to linting
- IDE performance may be affected by real-time linting

## Next Steps
- Fix npm permission issue by running: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`
- Install dependencies: `npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-next eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier prettier @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-import`
- Run `npm run check-all` to verify setup
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
- Consider adding VS Code workspace settings for automatic formatting

## Notes
- ESLint configuration extends Next.js recommended settings and includes TypeScript, React hooks, accessibility, and import ordering rules
- Prettier configuration uses single quotes, trailing commas, 100 character line width, and 2-space indentation
- Scripts added allow for both checking and auto-fixing of issues
- The `check-all` script runs type checking, linting, and format checking in sequence
- npm cache permission issue prevented automatic dependency installation

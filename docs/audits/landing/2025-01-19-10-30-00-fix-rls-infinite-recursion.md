# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-19 10:30:00

## Prompt Summary
User showed unauthorized access page. Debug logs revealed RLS infinite recursion error preventing admin user lookup.

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed debug output showing authentication flow
2. Identified PostgreSQL error 42P17: infinite recursion in RLS policy
3. Created fix scripts to resolve RLS recursion
4. Prepared admin user creation commands
5. Provided both comprehensive and quick fix options

## Files Changed
- `FIX_RLS_RECURSION.sql` - Comprehensive fix for RLS policies
- `QUICK_FIX_ADMIN.sql` - Quick solution to get login working immediately

## Root Cause Analysis
**Issue:** RLS policy on `admin_users` table causes infinite recursion
**Error:** `'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "admin_users"'`

The debug logs showed:
- ✅ Email `phil@pixelversestudios.io` correctly in allowlist
- ✅ Google OAuth successful (User ID: 234dbcfa-1f7c-48b3-bd4a-7bb1c481d3bd)
- ❌ Database query failed due to RLS policy recursion

**Why It Happened:**
The RLS policy likely checks if a user is an admin by querying `admin_users`, which triggers the same RLS policy again, creating an infinite loop.

## Solution Provided

### Quick Fix (QUICK_FIX_ADMIN.sql)
1. Disable RLS on admin_users table
2. Insert admin user record
3. Login works immediately

### Comprehensive Fix (FIX_RLS_RECURSION.sql)
1. Drop problematic recursive policies
2. Create admin user
3. Implement simpler, non-recursive policies
4. Re-enable RLS with proper policies

## Testing Considerations
- After applying fix, attempt login again
- Verify admin dashboard loads
- Check that audit logs are created
- Ensure other admin functions work

## Performance Impact
- None - RLS policies are evaluated at query time
- Simpler policies may actually improve performance
- No application code changes required

## Next Steps
1. Run QUICK_FIX_ADMIN.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test login at http://localhost:3001/admin/login
3. Once confirmed working, apply comprehensive fix for production

## Notes
The infinite recursion in RLS policies is a common PostgreSQL issue when policies reference their own table. The fix uses simpler policies that:
- Allow any authenticated user to read admin_users (security maintained at app level)
- Allow service role full access for system operations
- Avoid self-referential checks that cause recursion

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:01:25

## Prompt Summary
Added site navigation links for newly created About, Pricing, and FAQ pages.

## Actions Taken
1. Updated `Header` component to include navigation entries for `/about`, `/pricing`, and `/faq`.
2. Ensured navigation is visible on both desktop and mobile breakpoints.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added navigation links and responsive layout adjustments for the header.

## Components/Features Affected
- Header navigation
- Global site layout

## Testing Considerations
- Verify links render correctly across breakpoints.
- Confirm navigation links route to the expected pages without layout shift.

## Performance Impact
- Negligible; additional Link components only.

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Navigation duplicates link set for mobile (`md:hidden`) to keep implementation lightweight.

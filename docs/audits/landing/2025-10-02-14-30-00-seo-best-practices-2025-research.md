## 1. TECHNICAL SEO REQUIREMENTS FOR 2025

### Core Web Vitals (Critical for Rankings)
Google's Core Web Vitals are now essential ranking signals. The 2025 metrics include:

**Current Metrics:**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Target < 2.5 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Target < 0.1
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Target < 200ms (replaces FID in 2025)

**Key Optimization Strategies:**
- Reduce image sizes and use next/image component for automatic optimization
- Use priority prop for hero images (LCP elements)
- Implement browser caching and CDN for static assets
- Combine files to minimize browser requests
- Reserve space for dynamic content to prevent layout shifts
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout-triggering properties

**Statistics:**
- 88.5% of visitors leave websites due to slow loading times
- Pages with good Core Web Vitals have 24% lower bounce rates

### Mobile-First Indexing (Non-Negotiable)
**Requirements:**
- Google uses mobile version for crawling and ranking (not desktop)
- 63% of people use phones to research SaaS products
- Responsive design must work flawlessly on all viewport sizes
- Touch targets must be minimum 48x48 pixels
- Font sizes must be readable without zooming (minimum 16px)

### Crawling & Indexing Infrastructure

**robots.txt Configuration:**
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /_next/
Disallow: /private/

Sitemap: https://domani.app/sitemap.xml
```

**Best Practices:**
- Block non-essential pages (login, cart, admin panels, API routes)
- Keep important pages accessible to crawlers
- Test using Google Search Console's robots.txt tester
- Never block /static/ or core _next/ assets that are required

**XML Sitemap:**
- Include all pages you want ranked
- Update automatically when content changes
- Priority levels: Homepage (1.0), Key pages (0.8), Blog posts (0.6)
- Include lastmod dates for content freshness signals
- Submit to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools

### Site Architecture & Internal Linking
**Hub-and-Spoke Model:**
- Create hub pages for broad topics (e.g., "Productivity Tips")
- Use internal links to connect related content
- Keep important pages within 2-3 clicks from homepage
- Use descriptive anchor text with keywords
- Implement breadcrumb navigation for hierarchy

### Canonical Tags & Duplicate Content
**Implementation:**
- Use canonical tags on all pages to prevent duplicate content issues
- Essential for dynamically generated URLs
- Point to preferred version when multiple URLs show same content
- Required for pagination and filter pages

### International SEO (Future-Proofing)
**hreflang Tags:**
- Direct users to regional content versions
- Required for global expansion
- Format: `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-us" href="..." />`

## 3. CORE WEB VITALS OPTIMIZATION FOR NEXT.JS

### Next.js-Specific Optimization Strategies

#### 3.1 Image Optimization (Critical for LCP)
**next/image Component:**
```typescript
import Image from 'next/image';

// Hero image (LCP element)
<Image
  src="/hero-image.jpg"
  alt="Plan tomorrow tonight"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority // Preload this image first
  quality={85}
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
/>

// Regular images
<Image
  src="/feature.jpg"
  alt="Feature description"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  loading="lazy" // Lazy load non-critical images
  quality={85}
/>
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic resizing and compression
- WebP/AVIF format generation
- Lazy loading by default
- Prevents layout shift with size reservation

#### 3.2 React Server Components & Streaming
**App Router Benefits:**
- Reduce client JavaScript bundle size
- Stream content as it becomes ready
- Lower Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Improve INP (Interaction to Next Paint)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/page.tsx (Server Component by default)
export default async function Page() {
  // Data fetching on server
  const data = await fetchData();

  return (
    <div>
      <Hero /> {/* Static content renders immediately */}
      <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSkeleton />}>
        <DynamicContent data={data} /> {/* Streams when ready */}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3.3 Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)
**Next.js 15 Feature:**
- Static shell loads instantly
- Dynamic parts stream in progressively
- Best of static + dynamic rendering
- Significantly improves perceived performance

**Configuration:**
```typescript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true
  }
};
```

#### 3.4 Script Optimization
**next/script Component:**
```typescript
import Script from 'next/script';

// Analytics (load after interactive)
<Script
  src="https://analytics.domani.app/script.js"
  strategy="lazyOnload"
/>

// Critical third-party scripts
<Script
  src="https://necessary-script.com/script.js"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
```

**Strategies:**
- `beforeInteractive`: Critical scripts only
- `afterInteractive`: Important but not critical
- `lazyOnload`: Analytics, non-essential tracking

#### 3.5 Font Optimization
**next/font Module:**
```typescript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/inter';

const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap', // Prevent invisible text
  variable: '--font-inter'
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={inter.variable}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic font preloading
- No layout shift from font loading
- Self-hosted fonts for privacy/speed
- Eliminates external font requests

#### 3.6 Layout Shift Prevention (CLS)
**Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Always specify dimensions
<Image width={800} height={600} />

// Reserve space for dynamic content
<div style={{ minHeight: '200px' }}>
  {loading ? <Skeleton /> : <Content />}
</div>

// Use CSS transforms for animations (not width/height)
.animated {
  transform: translateX(0);
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}
.animated:hover {
  transform: translateX(10px);
}
```

#### 3.7 Bundle Optimization
**Next.js Configuration:**
```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Image optimization
  images: {
    domains: ['cdn.domani.app'],
    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
    minimumCacheTTL: 60
  },

  // CSS optimization
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
    optimizePackageImports: ['lucide-react', 'framer-motion']
  },

  // Webpack optimization
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // Tree shaking
    config.optimization.usedExports = true;

    // Split chunks intelligently
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      config.optimization.splitChunks = {
        chunks: 'all',
        cacheGroups: {
          framework: {
            name: 'framework',
            test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](react|react-dom)[\\/]/,
            priority: 40,
            enforce: true
          }
        }
      };
    }

    return config;
  }
};
```

#### 3.8 Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
**Real User Monitoring (RUM):**
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <SpeedInsights />
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

**Tools for Monitoring:**
- Vercel Analytics (built-in for Vercel deployments)
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- Web Vitals Chrome Extension
- Google Search Console Core Web Vitals report

**Performance Targets:**
- LCP: < 2.5s (good), < 4s (needs improvement), > 4s (poor)
- INP: < 200ms (good), < 500ms (needs improvement), > 500ms (poor)
- CLS: < 0.1 (good), < 0.25 (needs improvement), > 0.25 (poor)

# How We Built Domani: A Founder's Story

I used to wake up at 6 AM in a panic. My mind would race with everything I needed to do, and by the time I actually started working, I'd already wasted 2 hours in decision fatigue.

That's why we built Domani. Not because we read about evening planning in a book, but because we lived through the chaos of reactive mornings and discovered the power of planning the night before.

Over 18 months of development and testing with 500+ beta users, we refined the evening planning process into a simple system that actually works.
```

"Before Domani, I would spend my first hour at work just figuring out what to work on. Now I wake up, open the app, and my Most Important Task is right there. I've completed more meaningful work in 3 months than the previous year."

- Sarah Chen, Product Manager at TechCorp
- Using Domani for 4 months
- Increased daily task completion by 67%
```

# How We Designed the Plan Lock Feature

The "Plan Lock" feature came from user testing. We noticed that beta users would create perfect plans at 9 PM, then change everything at 10 PM, 11 PM, and even midnight. The overthinking defeated the purpose.

So we added a simple lock mechanism. Once you finalize your plan, it's locked until morning. Can't change it, can't add to it. At first, users were nervous. But the feedback was overwhelming: "It's like giving myself permission to stop thinking and just rest."

### Key Conversion Elements for Domani

#### 7.1 Value Proposition (Above the Fold)

**Formula: Problem + Solution + Benefit**

```html
<section class="hero">
  <!-- Eyebrow (Social Proof) -->
  <span class="badge">Join 10,000+ productive professionals</span>

  <!-- Main Headline (Clear Value) -->
  <h1>Plan Tomorrow Tonight, Wake Up Ready to Execute</h1>

  <!-- Subheadline (Emotional Benefit) -->
  <p>Transform overwhelming mornings into focused execution.
     The evening planning app that gives you back your mornings.</p>

  <!-- Primary CTA -->
  <button>Start Free - No Credit Card Required</button>

  <!-- Secondary CTA -->
  <button>Watch Demo (2 min)</button>

  <!-- Trust Signal -->
  <p>Free forever. Upgrade when ready. Cancel anytime.</p>
</section>
```

**Key Principles:**
- Focus on visitor's needs, not product features
- Lead with emotional benefit
- Clear, specific promise
- Remove friction (no credit card, free plan)

#### 7.2 Call-to-Action Optimization

**CTA Button Best Practices:**

**Button Text Variations (A/B Test These):**
```
High-Performing CTAs:
✓ "Start Free"
✓ "Get Started Free"
✓ "Try Domani Free"
✓ "Join 10,000+ Users"
✓ "Plan Your First Evening"

Low-Performing CTAs:
✗ "Submit"
✗ "Click Here"
✗ "Learn More"
✗ "Sign Up"
```

**CTA Design:**
```css
.cta-primary {
  /* High contrast color */
  background: #6366f1; /* Primary brand color */
  color: white;

  /* Large, clickable */
  padding: 16px 32px;
  font-size: 18px;
  min-height: 48px; /* Mobile-friendly */

  /* Visual hierarchy */
  font-weight: 600;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.3);

  /* Interactive feedback */
  transition: transform 0.2s, box-shadow 0.2s;
}

.cta-primary:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 6px 20px rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.4);
}
```

**CTA Placement Strategy:**
```
Primary CTA Locations:
1. Hero section (above fold) - Most critical
2. After problem/solution section
3. After features section
4. After testimonials
5. After pricing
6. Sticky footer on mobile
7. Exit-intent popup (optional)

Recommendation: 3-5 CTA instances per page
```

    <img src="/logos/shopify.svg" alt="Shopify" />
    <img src="/logos/notion.svg" alt="Notion" />
  </div>
</section>
```

#### 7.4 Mobile Optimization (Critical)

**Mobile-Specific Considerations:**

**Sticky CTA on Mobile:**
```html
<!-- Fixed to bottom on mobile -->
<div class="mobile-cta-bar">
  <button class="cta-primary full-width">
    Start Free
  </button>
</div>

<style>
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .mobile-cta-bar {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    padding: 16px;
    background: white;
    box-shadow: 0 -4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    z-index: 100;
  }
}
</style>
```

**Mobile-First Design:**
```
Mobile Checklist:
[ ] Text size minimum 16px (prevents zoom)
[ ] Touch targets minimum 48x48px
[ ] Single-column layout
[ ] Simplified navigation (hamburger menu)
[ ] Fast image loading (next/image)
[ ] Reduced animations for performance
[ ] Easy thumb-friendly CTAs
[ ] Form fields large and spaced
```

#### 7.5 Message Match & Consistency

**Principle: Ad → Landing Page → Product**

```
Example Flow:

Google Ad:
"Plan Tomorrow Tonight - Start Free"

Landing Page Headline (Matches Ad):
"Plan Tomorrow Tonight, Wake Up Ready"

Form Page:
"Start Planning Your Evenings"

Thank You Page:
"You're ready to plan your first evening!"
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces cognitive dissonance
- Increases trust
- Improves conversion by up to 50%
- Lowers bounce rate

#### 7.6 Page Speed for Conversions

**Speed = Conversions:**
- 1 second delay = 7% conversion loss
- 3+ seconds = 53% abandonment
- Mobile users especially sensitive

**Optimization Priorities:**
```
1. Optimize hero image (largest contentful paint)
2. Preload critical fonts
3. Defer non-critical JavaScript
4. Use CDN for assets
5. Minimize third-party scripts
6. Enable compression
7. Cache aggressively
```

### 8.1 Sitemap Generation (Dynamic)

**Implementation: `app/sitemap.ts`**

```typescript
// app/sitemap.ts
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next';

export default async function sitemap(): Promise<MetadataRoute.Sitemap> {
  const baseUrl = 'https://domani.app';

  // Static pages
  const staticPages = [
    {
      url: baseUrl,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'daily' as const,
      priority: 1.0,
    },
    {
      url: `${baseUrl}/pricing`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
      priority: 0.8,
    },
    {
      url: `${baseUrl}/about`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const,
      priority: 0.6,
    },
    {
      url: `${baseUrl}/blog`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
      priority: 0.7,
    },
  ];

  // Dynamic blog posts (example)
  const blogPosts = await getBlogPosts(); // Fetch from CMS or filesystem
  const blogPages = blogPosts.map((post) => ({
    url: `${baseUrl}/blog/${post.slug}`,
    lastModified: new Date(post.updatedAt),
    changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const,
    priority: 0.6,
  }));

  return [...staticPages, ...blogPages];
}

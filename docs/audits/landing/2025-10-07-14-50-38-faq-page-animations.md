# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:50:38

## Prompt Summary
Added homepage-style motion transitions to the FAQ page.

## Actions Taken
1. Created `FAQContent` client component that wraps FAQ header, accordion, and CTA with Framer Motion animations.
2. Updated `/faq` server page to pass FAQ data into the new animated component.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/faq/FAQContent.tsx` - New animated FAQ layout leveraging `FAQAccordion`.
- `src/app/faq/page.tsx` - Simplified page to render `FAQContent`.

## Components/Features Affected
- FAQ page presentation

## Testing Considerations
- Ensure `/faq` loads without serialization errors and animations trigger on scroll.
- Confirm accordion functionality remains intact after refactor.

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; reuses existing Framer Motion dependency.

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Animation timings align with About/Pricing pages for consistent experience.

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-22 09:53:06

## Prompt Summary
Fixed the missing email display issue in the admin sidebar. The user object was not containing the email field that needed to be fetched from the auth.users table.

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed the AdminUserWithDetails type definition to understand the expected structure
2. Investigated the verify API endpoint to see how user data was being fetched
3. Modified the verify endpoint to fetch the email from auth.users table using Supabase admin API
4. Updated AdminSidebar to display "Admin User" as fallback when email is not available
5. Removed the re-added console.log statement from AdminSidebar

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/admin/auth/verify/route.ts` - Added logic to fetch email from auth.users table and include it in the response
- `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Removed console.log and updated fallback text for email display

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin authentication verify endpoint
- Admin sidebar user display section
- Admin user data fetching

## Testing Considerations
- Verify the email now displays correctly in the admin sidebar
- Ensure the API endpoint handles cases where user_id might be null
- Test that the fallback "Admin User" text displays when email is unavailable
- Check that authentication still works correctly with the modified data structure

## Performance Impact
- Minor additional database query to fetch user email from auth.users table
- This query only runs during session verification, not on every request
- Impact is minimal as it's a single row lookup by ID

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any authentication issues
- Consider caching the email to avoid repeated lookups
- May want to modify the admin_users table schema to include email directly for better performance

## Notes
The issue was that the admin_users table doesn't store the email directly - it only has a reference to the user_id in the auth.users table. The verify endpoint was not joining or fetching the email from the auth.users table.

The fix uses Supabase's admin API to fetch the user details by ID, which includes the email. This maintains proper separation between admin roles and auth user data while providing the needed information for display.

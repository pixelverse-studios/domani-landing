# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-18 11:50:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to update the admin dashboard todo list to mark completed items as done.

## Actions Taken
1. Marked Phase 1 tasks (1-3) as complete with checkboxes
2. Added "âœ… COMPLETE" label to Phase 1 header
3. Added Current Status section at the top showing progress overview
4. Updated Summary section with completed/remaining task counts
5. Added progress percentage (6.4% complete)

## Files Changed
- `docs/admin-dashboard-todo-list.md` - Updated to reflect completed Phase 1 tasks

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin Dashboard planning documentation
- Phase 1: Foundation Setup (React Query & Dependencies)

## Testing Considerations
- Verify QueryProvider is working correctly before proceeding to Phase 2
- Test that all Phase 1 dependencies are properly installed
- Confirm React Query DevTools work in development

## Performance Impact
None - Documentation update only

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Database Schema Setup
- Create Supabase tables for admin functionality
- Set up Row Level Security policies
- Consider creating a project board to track progress visually

## Notes
Phase 1 is now marked as complete with all 3 tasks checked off. The document now clearly shows that the React Query foundation is in place, making it easy to see what's done and what remains. The Current Status section provides a quick overview of progress at a glance.

- Included HTML sanitization and rendering

### 2. Created Campaign Management Hooks
- Implemented `useCampaigns` hook for listing campaigns
- Added `useCampaign` hook for single campaign fetching
- Created mutation hooks for create, update, delete operations
- Implemented template management hooks
- Added proper error handling and toast notifications
- Included cache invalidation strategies

### 3. Built Campaign List Page
- Created card-based layout for campaign display

- Added hover effects and animations

### 4. Built Campaign Creation Page

- Step 2: Email content with rich text editor
- Step 3: Recipient selection from waitlist
- Step 4: Review and scheduling options
- Added progress indicator
- Implemented form validation with Zod
- Created draft save and schedule functionality

### 5. Created Campaign API Routes
- **GET /api/admin/campaigns**
  - Lists campaigns with pagination
  - Calculates metrics (open rate, click rate)
  - Supports filtering by status and search
  
- **POST /api/admin/campaigns**
  - Creates new campaign
  - Links recipients from waitlist
  - Validates required fields
  
- **GET /api/admin/campaigns/[id]**
  - Fetches single campaign with metrics
  - Includes recipient details
  
- **PATCH /api/admin/campaigns/[id]**
  - Updates draft campaigns only
  - Validates editable status
  
- **DELETE /api/admin/campaigns/[id]**
  - Deletes draft campaigns only
  - Cascades recipient deletion

## Files Changed
- `src/components/admin/EmailComposer.tsx` - Rich text email editor component
- `src/hooks/useCampaigns.ts` - React Query hooks for campaigns
- `src/app/admin/campaigns/page.tsx` - Campaign list page
- `src/app/admin/campaigns/new/page.tsx` - Campaign creation wizard
- `src/app/api/admin/campaigns/route.ts` - Campaign list/create API
- `src/app/api/admin/campaigns/[id]/route.ts` - Campaign detail API
- `docs/admin-dashboard-todo-list.md` - Updated progress tracking

## Components/Features Affected
- Email composition with rich text editing
- Campaign management dashboard
- Recipient selection interface
- Campaign scheduling system
- Metrics tracking and display
- Multi-step form wizard

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX Approach
- **Card-based layout** for visual hierarchy
- **Multi-step wizard** to reduce cognitive load
- **Live preview** for immediate feedback
- **Status badges** for quick scanning
- **Responsive grid** for various screen sizes

### Technical Architecture
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Tiptap** for rich text editing (modern, extensible)
- **Zod** for runtime validation
- **React Hook Form** for form management
- **Optimistic updates** for better UX

### Data Flow
- Campaigns linked to waitlist users via junction table
- Metrics calculated on-demand from recipient data
- Draft campaigns remain editable
- Sent campaigns become immutable

## Testing Considerations
- Test multi-step form navigation
- Verify recipient selection logic
- Test campaign creation with various content
- Ensure draft vs sent campaign permissions
- Test pagination and filtering
- Verify metrics calculations
- Test rich text editor across browsers

## Performance Impact
- Tiptap editor adds ~150KB to bundle
- Card animations use CSS transforms (GPU accelerated)
- Pagination prevents loading all campaigns at once
- React Query caching reduces API calls
- Lazy loading for editor reduces initial load

## Next Steps

### Phase 9: Email Sending Integration
- Integrate with Resend API
- Implement batch sending logic
- Add rate limiting
- Create email templates
- Handle bounce/complaint webhooks

### Immediate Tasks
- Test campaign creation flow end-to-end
- Add loading states to all async operations
- Implement email template management
- Add campaign duplication feature
- Create campaign analytics dashboard

## UI/UX Highlights

### Modern Design Patterns
- **Glassmorphism** effects on cards
- **Smooth transitions** between states
- **Color-coded statuses** for quick recognition
- **Progressive disclosure** in multi-step form
- **Contextual help** at each step

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus management in wizard
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader announcements

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Stack layout on small screens
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Simplified toolbar on mobile
- Responsive preview modes

## Metrics & Analytics

### Campaign Metrics Tracked
- Total recipients
- Emails sent
- Open rate
- Click rate
- Bounce rate
- Unsubscribe rate
- Delivery rate

### Future Enhancements
- A/B testing capabilities
- Advanced segmentation
- Automated drip campaigns
- Email engagement heatmaps
- Conversion tracking
- ROI calculations

## Security Considerations
- HTML content sanitization
- Admin-only API access
- Draft campaign protection
- Audit logging for all actions
- Rate limiting on API routes

## Notes
- EmailComposer supports variable placeholders for personalization
- Campaign wizard saves progress between steps
- Recipients can be selected individually or in bulk
- Scheduling feature ready for Phase 9 integration
- UI follows established design system from waitlist pages

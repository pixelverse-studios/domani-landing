# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:47:16

## Prompt Summary
Added animated transitions to the pricing page similar to the homepage motion system.

## Actions Taken
1. Built a `PricingContent` client component that applies Framer Motion staggered animations to hero copy, plan cards, FAQs, and trust messaging.
2. Refactored `/pricing` to supply serializable plan and FAQ data to the client component.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/pricing/PricingContent.tsx` - New animated pricing layout with motion variants.
- `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` - Passes plan and FAQ data into `PricingContent`.

## Components/Features Affected
- Pricing page layout & animations

## Testing Considerations
- Ensure `/pricing` renders without hydration warnings and animations trigger on scroll.
- Validate “Most Popular” badge and CTA hover interactions behave as expected.

## Performance Impact
- Adds Framer Motion usage to pricing page; overall impact minimal and consistent with other marketing sections.

## Next Steps
- Optionally align animation timings across marketing pages via shared helpers.

## Notes
- Plan data remains server-defined to preserve metadata generation while animations execute client-side.

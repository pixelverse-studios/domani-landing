# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-17 14:52:00

## Prompt Summary
Fix the issue where users signing up to the waitlist are not receiving welcome/confirmation emails. The feature was reported to have worked previously but is no longer functioning.

## Investigation Results
After thorough investigation, discovered that **email sending was never actually implemented** in the codebase despite:
- Resend package being installed (`resend@6.0.3`)
- API key configured in `.env.local`
- Database schema supporting email confirmation fields
- Documentation mentioning email functionality

The waitlist API was only storing data to Supabase without sending any emails.

## Actions Taken
1. **Created email template system**:
   - Built `src/emails/waitlist-welcome.tsx` with HTML and text versions
   - Professional, responsive design with Domani branding
   - Clear messaging about joining the waitlist
   - Social sharing CTAs included

2. **Implemented Resend email service**:
   - Created `src/lib/email/resend.ts` with reusable email functions
   - Configured proper error handling and logging
   - Added support for welcome emails and admin notifications
   - Implemented test email functionality for debugging

3. **Updated waitlist API endpoint**:
   - Integrated email sending after successful database insertion
   - Implemented async email sending (non-blocking)
   - Graceful error handling - email failures don't break signup
   - Updated success message to indicate email confirmation

4. **Created test endpoint**:
   - Added `/api/test-email` for testing email functionality
   - Supports both simple test emails and welcome email templates
   - Useful for debugging and verification

5. **Tested implementation**:
   - Successfully sent test emails to verified address
   - Confirmed waitlist signup triggers email send
   - Verified error handling for non-verified recipients

## Files Changed
- `src/emails/waitlist-welcome.tsx` - Created welcome email template (HTML + text)
- `src/lib/email/resend.ts` - Created Resend email service module
- `src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts` - Updated to send confirmation emails
- `src/app/api/test-email/route.ts` - Created test endpoint for email debugging

## Components/Features Affected
- Waitlist signup flow now includes email confirmation
- User experience improved with immediate email feedback
- Admin notification system ready (currently commented out)
- Test infrastructure for email debugging

## Testing Considerations
- Email sending only works for verified domains/addresses in test mode
- Currently using `onboarding@resend.dev` as sender (update for production)
- Test emails confirmed working to `phil@pixelversestudios.io`
- Need to verify domain for production use

## Performance Impact
- Minimal - emails sent asynchronously
- Non-blocking - API response not delayed by email sending
- Graceful degradation - signup succeeds even if email fails
- No additional bundle size for frontend

## Configuration Requirements
### For Production Deployment:
1. **Verify domain** at resend.com/domains
2. **Update sender address** in `src/lib/email/resend.ts`:
   - Change from `onboarding@resend.dev`
   - To: `hello@domani.app` or similar verified address
3. **Configure admin email** for notifications (optional)
4. **Remove test endpoint** (`/api/test-email`) in production

## Next Steps
1. Verify domani.app domain with Resend for production
2. Update sender email address once domain is verified
3. Enable admin notifications if desired
4. Monitor email delivery rates and errors
5. Consider adding email tracking/analytics
6. Remove or protect test endpoint before production

## Email Template Features
- **Responsive design**: Works on all devices
- **Brand consistency**: Uses Domani purple gradient
- **Clear CTAs**: Visit website and social sharing
- **Professional tone**: Welcoming and informative
- **Accessibility**: Text version included
- **Personalization**: Uses user's first name

## Testing Results
✅ Email service properly initialized
✅ Welcome emails sent successfully to verified addresses
✅ Waitlist API integration working correctly
✅ Error handling prevents signup failures
✅ Logging provides debugging information
⚠️ Domain verification needed for production

## Notes
- The issue was not that emails "stopped working" - they were never implemented
- Documentation incorrectly suggested email functionality existed
- Current implementation is fully functional but limited to test addresses
- Production readiness requires domain verification with Resend

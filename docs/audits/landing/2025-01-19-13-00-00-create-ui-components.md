# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-19 13:00:00

## Prompt Summary
Admin page was failing to load due to missing UI components (Card and Button). Created the required components to fix the issue.

## Actions Taken
1. Identified missing UI components from error messages
2. Created Card components (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, etc.)
3. Created Button component with variants and sizes
4. Installed required dependencies (@radix-ui/react-slot, class-variance-authority)
5. Tested that components resolve correctly

## Files Changed
- `src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Created complete Card component system
- `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Created Button component with variants
- `package.json` - Added @radix-ui/react-slot and class-variance-authority

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin dashboard page
- All future pages requiring Card or Button components
- UI component library

## Component Details

### Card Components
- **Card**: Base container with border and shadow
- **CardHeader**: Header section with padding
- **CardTitle**: Title text with proper styling
- **CardDescription**: Muted text for descriptions
- **CardContent**: Main content area
- **CardFooter**: Footer section for actions

### Button Component
- **Variants**: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link
- **Sizes**: default, sm, lg, icon
- **Features**: Focus states, hover states, disabled states
- **Accessibility**: Proper keyboard navigation and focus rings

## Testing Considerations
- Components use existing Tailwind classes
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistency
- Work with existing design system (CSS variables)
- TypeScript fully typed with proper interfaces

## Performance Impact
- Minimal - components are lightweight React components
- Use React.forwardRef for proper ref forwarding
- No heavy dependencies added

## Next Steps
1. Login to admin dashboard to test full functionality
2. May need to create additional UI components as needed
3. Consider adding more shadcn/ui components if required

## Notes
The admin dashboard was trying to import shadcn/ui style components that didn't exist in the project. Created minimal but fully functional implementations that match the expected API and styling patterns. These components can be extended with additional features as needed.

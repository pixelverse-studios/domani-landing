## Prompt Summary
Proceed with Phase 7 of the admin dashboard implementation: Email Campaign Database schema creation.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Research Phase
- Researched modern email marketing platform database schemas (Mailchimp, SendGrid, ConvertKit)
- Studied best practices for email campaign database design
- Researched UI/UX patterns for email campaign dashboards on Dribbble
- Analyzed essential tables, tracking metrics, and performance considerations

### 2. Database Schema Implementation
Created comprehensive email campaign database schema with the following tables:

#### **email_templates**
- Store reusable email templates
- Support for HTML and plain text versions
- Variable placeholders for personalization
- Categories for organization (welcome, newsletter, promotion, etc.)
- Soft delete support for recovery

#### **email_campaigns**
- Campaign management with status tracking
- Support for manual, automated, and triggered campaigns
- Scheduling capabilities
- Comprehensive metrics tracking
- Settings for tracking preferences

#### **campaign_recipients**
- Track individual email sends
- Link to waitlist users
- Delivery status tracking
- Engagement metrics (opens, clicks)
- Bounce and unsubscribe handling

#### **email_unsubscribes**
- Global suppression list
- Unsubscribe reasons and feedback
- Re-subscription support

### 3. Supporting Features
- Helper functions for metrics calculation
- Subscription status checking
- Row Level Security policies for admin access
- Update timestamp triggers
- Sample data for quick start

### 4. TypeScript Types
Created comprehensive type definitions in `src/types/email.ts`:
- Enums for all status types
- Interfaces matching database tables
- Request/response types for API
- Utility functions for UI helpers
- Type guards for validation

## Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/20250119_email_campaign_schema.sql` - Complete database migration
- `src/types/email.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `docs/admin-dashboard-todo-list.md` - Updated progress tracking

## Components/Features Affected
- Email template management system
- Campaign creation and scheduling
- Recipient targeting and segmentation
- Email delivery tracking
- Engagement metrics
- Unsubscribe management

## Design Decisions

### Simplified MVP Approach
- Started with core functionality rather than full enterprise features
- Used JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- Leveraged existing waitlist table for recipients
- Included essential tracking without complex analytics

### Security & Privacy
- Row Level Security policies for all tables
- Soft deletes for data recovery
- Public unsubscribe capability
- Admin-only access for viewing data

### Scalability Considerations
- UUID primary keys for distributed systems
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Separate tracking tables for performance
- Support for future partitioning

## Testing Considerations
- Test migration application
- Verify RLS policies work correctly
- Test helper functions
- Ensure TypeScript types match database
- Test unsubscribe flow

## Performance Impact
- Efficient indexes on key lookup fields
- Separate tables for tracking vs content
- JSONB for flexible but indexed data
- Prepared for table partitioning as needed

## Next Steps

### Phase 8: Email Campaign UI
- Build EmailComposer component with rich text editor
- Create campaign management pages
- Implement template management UI
- Add recipient selection interface

### Migration Application
To apply this migration to your Supabase database:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Create new query
3. Paste contents of `20250119_email_campaign_schema.sql`
4. Execute the migration

## Notes
- Schema supports future A/B testing capabilities
- Designed for integration with Resend or similar email providers
- Metrics structure allows for real-time campaign monitoring
- Template system supports both inline content and template references
- Comprehensive tracking without sacrificing performance

## Design Patterns Applied

### Database Design
- **Normalized structure** with clear relationships
- **JSONB flexibility** for evolving requirements
- **Audit trails** on all tables
- **Soft deletes** for data recovery

### Type Safety
- **Complete TypeScript coverage** for all entities
- **Enums** for all status fields
- **Type guards** for runtime validation
- **Utility functions** for common operations

### Security
- **RLS policies** on all tables
- **Admin role verification** for access
- **Public unsubscribe** capability
- **Token-based** unsubscribe links

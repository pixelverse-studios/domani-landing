# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-19 14:30:00

## Prompt Summary
Replace mock data in the admin dashboard with actual data from the database.

## Actions Taken
1. Created API endpoints to fetch real dashboard data:
   - `/api/admin/dashboard/stats` - Returns statistics (users, sessions, security events, API calls)
   - `/api/admin/dashboard/activity` - Returns recent activity from audit logs and signups
   - `/api/admin/dashboard/alerts` - Returns system alerts and warnings

2. Created React Query hooks for fetching dashboard data:
   - `useDashboardStats()` - Fetches statistics with real-time updates
   - `useRecentActivity()` - Fetches recent activities
   - `useSystemAlerts()` - Fetches system alerts
   - `useDashboardData()` - Combined hook for all dashboard data

3. Updated dashboard UI to consume real data:
   - Replaced hardcoded statistics with database counts
   - Added loading skeletons for better UX
   - Implemented error handling and empty states
   - Added auto-refresh for real-time updates

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/admin/dashboard/stats/route.ts` - New stats API endpoint
- `src/app/api/admin/dashboard/activity/route.ts` - New activity API endpoint
- `src/app/api/admin/dashboard/alerts/route.ts` - New alerts API endpoint
- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts` - New React Query hooks for dashboard data
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Updated dashboard to use real data

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin Dashboard statistics cards
- Recent Activity section
- System Alerts section
- Dashboard data refresh intervals

## Testing Considerations
- Test with no data (empty database)
- Test with large amounts of data
- Test refresh intervals and real-time updates
- Test error states and network failures
- Verify calculations for trends and growth percentages

## Performance Impact
- Reduced initial bundle size (no hardcoded data)
- Multiple API calls on dashboard load (can be optimized with parallel fetching)
- Real-time updates every minute for stats
- Caching configured for optimal performance

## Next Steps
- Consider adding data export functionality
- Implement date range filters for statistics
- Add more granular metrics (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add ability to dismiss/acknowledge alerts

## Notes
- Statistics now show real data from waitlist, admin_sessions, and admin_audit_log tables
- Trends are calculated by comparing different time periods
- Activity feed combines audit logs and waitlist signups
- Alerts are generated based on security events and system status
- All data respects admin authentication and authorization

## Data Sources
- **Total Users**: Count from `waitlist` table
- **Active Sessions**: Count from `admin_sessions` where not expired
- **Security Events**: Failed login attempts from `admin_audit_log` (last 24h)
- **API Calls**: All audit log entries (last hour)
- **Recent Activity**: Combined from `admin_audit_log` and `waitlist` tables
- **System Alerts**: Generated from various security and system checks

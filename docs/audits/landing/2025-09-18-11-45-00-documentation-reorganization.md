# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-18 11:45:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to move all .md files into the docs directory and update claude.md to enforce keeping all future documentation within that folder.

## Actions Taken
1. Created new docs directory structure with subdirectories for audits, features, technical, and planning
2. Moved all existing audit files from `audits/landing/` to `docs/audits/landing/`
3. Moved all root-level documentation files to `docs/` directory
4. Updated `claude.md` to enforce new documentation structure
5. Added documentation requirements section highlighting the docs/ directory requirement
6. Updated project structure in claude.md to reflect docs/ location
7. Added principle #11 about documentation location
8. Updated landing page mantras to include docs directory requirement

## Files Changed
- `claude.md` - Updated with new documentation requirements and structure
- All `.md` files - Moved to `docs/` directory structure
- `docs/audits/landing/` - Contains all audit trail files
- Root directory - Cleaned of documentation files (except README.md and claude.md)

## Components/Features Affected
- Documentation organization
- Audit trail location
- Future documentation workflow

## Testing Considerations
- Verify all documentation links still work
- Ensure git history is preserved
- Check that automated tools can find docs in new location

## Performance Impact
- None - organizational change only

## Next Steps
- Update any scripts that reference old documentation paths
- Update README to mention docs/ directory structure
- Consider creating docs/README.md with documentation index

## Notes
Successfully reorganized all documentation into a centralized `docs/` directory. The claude.md file now enforces this structure for all future documentation, ensuring consistency and organization. The README.md and claude.md remain in root as they are project entry points.

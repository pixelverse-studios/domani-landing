# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-10-07 14:20:39

## Prompt Summary
Added smooth open/close transitions to FAQ dropdown items for better interaction feedback.

## Actions Taken
1. Replaced native `<details>` elements with a custom `FAQItem` component using React state.
2. Implemented height/opacity transitions, icon rotation, and accessible focus handling on toggles.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/faq/page.tsx` - Added `FAQItem` component, updated imports, and wired questions through the animated accordion.

## Components/Features Affected
- FAQ accordion interactions

## Testing Considerations
- Keyboard navigation on FAQ items should toggle sections and preserve focus styling.
- Confirm transition timing feels responsive on mobile devices.

## Performance Impact
- Minimal; stateful component per FAQ question only.

## Next Steps
- None

## Notes
- Transition height capped via `max-h-[480px]` to avoid layout shift while keeping content readable.

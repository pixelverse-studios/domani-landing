# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-20 14:30:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported getting a 403 Forbidden error when being redirected from Google OAuth in production, showing an "Unauthorized Access" page.

## Actions Taken
1. Investigated the OAuth callback implementation in `/src/app/api/admin/auth/google/callback/route.ts`
2. Checked the Netlify configuration in `netlify.toml`
3. Installed `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` to properly handle Next.js API routes on Netlify
4. Updated `netlify.toml` to include the Next.js plugin configuration
5. Created verification script `scripts/verify-oauth-setup.js` to help debug OAuth configuration
6. Identified the root cause: Netlify wasn't properly handling Next.js API routes

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Added `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` as a dev dependency
- `netlify.toml` - Added Next.js plugin configuration for proper API route handling
- `scripts/verify-oauth-setup.js` - Created verification script for OAuth setup

## Components/Features Affected
- Google OAuth authentication flow
- Admin authentication system
- API route handling in production

## Testing Considerations
- Verify redirect URLs are correctly configured in Supabase Dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are set in Netlify
- Test OAuth flow in incognito browser to avoid cache issues
- Verify allowed admin emails are configured correctly

## Performance Impact
- No performance impact
- Improved reliability of API routes on Netlify

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy these changes to Netlify**
2. **In Netlify Dashboard**, ensure these environment variables are set:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.domani-app.com`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `ADMIN_ALLOWED_EMAILS`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
3. **In Supabase Dashboard**, add this redirect URL:
   - `https://www.domani-app.com/api/admin/auth/google/callback`
4. Clear browser cache and test the OAuth flow again

## Notes
The 403 error was occurring because Netlify doesn't natively support Next.js API routes without the proper plugin. The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin enables Netlify to correctly handle Next.js server-side features including API routes, which are essential for the OAuth callback to work.

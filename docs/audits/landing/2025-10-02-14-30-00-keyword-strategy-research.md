## Notes

**Critical Insight:** The evening planning angle is Domani's biggest SEO opportunity. While search volume is lower than generic "productivity app" terms, the lack of competition means we can own this category completely.

**Methodology Advantage:** Content around Ivy Lee Method (4K searches) and MIT method (1.8K searches) builds authority while being genuinely helpful. Users discovering these methods will find Domani as the implementation tool.

**Timing Psychology:** Research showing optimal planning time is 5pm and peak productivity at 10:26am provides scientific backing for our "plan tonight, execute tomorrow" philosophy. This data can anchor multiple content pieces.

**Conversion Path:**
1. User searches "how to plan your day the night before"
2. Finds comprehensive Domani blog post
3. Learns about evening planning benefits
4. Sees Domani solves this exact problem
5. Signs up for free tier
6. Experiences value
7. Converts to premium

**Competitive Moat:** While competitors can copy features, they can't easily pivot to evening-first positioning. Their existing content, branding, and user expectations lock them into current positioning. Domani can own "evening planning" category.

**Risk Mitigation:** If "evening planning" search volume stays low, we're still capturing adjacent high-volume terms (daily planner app, time blocking, morning routine) with differentiated content that converts better due to our unique angle.

**Content Quality > Quantity:** Better to publish 4 exceptional posts/month than 8 mediocre ones. Focus on comprehensive guides (2,500+ words), original research, and genuinely helpful content.

**ASO Critical:** With 70% of app users discovering through search, ASO is as important as web SEO. The 100-character Apple keyword field and Google Play description need strategic optimization.

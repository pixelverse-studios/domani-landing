# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-17 14:30:00

## Prompt Summary
Implement Phase 1 of the admin dashboard todo list, setting up React Query foundation with dependencies, QueryProvider component, and root layout integration.

## Actions Taken
1. Researched best practices for React Query setup in Next.js 14 applications
2. Researched modern admin dashboard UI/UX patterns for 2024-2025
3. Installed required npm dependencies using yarn (npm had permission issues)
4. Created production-ready QueryClient configuration with optimized caching strategy
5. Created QueryProvider component with development DevTools
6. Integrated QueryProvider into root layout
7. Added Toaster component for toast notifications
8. Verified build and development server functionality

## Files Changed
- `package.json` - Added 12 new dependencies for admin dashboard functionality
- `src/lib/react-query/query-client.ts` - Created centralized QueryClient configuration
- `src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` - Created React Query provider component
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated QueryProvider and Toaster into app hierarchy

## Components/Features Affected
- Global application state management via React Query
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Development debugging with React Query DevTools
- Optimized caching strategies for different data types

## Testing Considerations
- Verify QueryClient singleton pattern works correctly
- Test error handling with simulated network failures
- Ensure DevTools only load in development
- Check that existing functionality isn't affected
- Test toast notifications appear correctly

## Performance Impact
- React Query bundle: ~13kb gzipped
- Total new dependencies: ~45kb gzipped
- Improved performance from intelligent caching
- Reduced server load from request deduplication
- Smart retry logic reduces unnecessary network requests

## Next Steps
- Phase 2: Create Supabase database schema for admin roles
- Implement admin authentication system
- Add admin-specific React Query hooks
- Configure role-based access control
- Set up audit logging for admin actions

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. React Query v5 Implementation
- Latest stable version with improved TypeScript support
- Better SSR/hydration handling for Next.js 14
- Smaller bundle size with tree-shaking

### 2. Caching Strategy
Implemented tiered caching approach:
- **Real-time data**: 30s stale time, 60s refetch interval
- **Reference data**: 30min stale time, no window focus refetch
- **User data**: 5min stale time
- **List data**: 2min stale time

### 3. Error Handling
- Global QueryCache error handler for centralized logging
- Toast notifications via Sonner for user feedback
- Smart retry logic:
  - No retry on 4xx errors (except 408/429)
  - 3 retries for network/5xx errors
  - Exponential backoff delay

### 4. Development Experience
- React Query DevTools in development
- Comprehensive error logging
- Pre-configured query options for common patterns

### 5. Production Optimizations
- Singleton QueryClient pattern for proper SSR/CSR
- Disabled refetchOnWindowFocus for admin panels
- Efficient garbage collection settings
- Request deduplication

## Dependencies Installed
```json
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.89.0",
  "@tanstack/react-table": "^8.21.3",
  "@tanstack/react-query-devtools": "^5.89.0",
  "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs": "^0.10.0",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.62.0",
  "@hookform/resolvers": "^5.2.2",
  "zod": "^4.1.9",
  "sonner": "^2.0.7",
  "@tiptap/react": "^3.4.4",
  "@tiptap/starter-kit": "^3.4.4",
  "date-fns": "^4.1.0",
  "cmdk": "^1.1.1"
}
```

## Notes
- Used yarn instead of npm due to cache permission issues
- Simplified production DevTools implementation (can be added later)
- All Phase 1 tasks completed successfully
- Application builds and runs without errors
- Ready for Phase 2: Database Schema Setup

## Notes

### Key Insights from Research

1. **Evening Planning is Untapped**: No major competitor owns this positioning. This is Domani's strongest differentiator and should be emphasized in all SEO efforts.

2. **Problem-Aware Keywords Convert Better**: Searches like "morning decision fatigue" and "overwhelmed every morning" indicate pain points. Target these before feature-based keywords.

3. **Methodology Content Builds Authority**: The Ivy Lee Method and MIT method have dedicated followings. Creating definitive guides positions Domani as the implementation tool.

4. **Comparison Content Captures Bottom-of-Funnel**: Users searching "sunsama alternative" are ready to switch. These pages convert at 15-20% vs 2-5% for informational content.

5. **Voice Search is Growing**: 40.7% of voice results come from featured snippets. FAQ schema and question-based content positions Domani for voice discovery.

### Technical Decisions

1. **Used Built-in Next.js Features**: Avoided external packages like next-sitemap and next-seo. Built-in Metadata API is more reliable and has zero dependencies.

2. **Schema-dts for Type Safety**: Chose schema-dts package for TypeScript autocomplete on structured data. Prevents invalid schema and improves developer experience.

3. **Centralized SEO Config**: Created reusable utilities in `/lib/seo/` for consistency. This makes updates easier and prevents copy-paste errors.

4. **Page-Specific Metadata**: Each page has custom metadata rather than relying solely on defaults. This maximizes relevance for target keywords.

### Content Strategy Philosophy

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to publish 4 exceptional articles than 8 mediocre ones. Google rewards depth and expertise.

2. **Problem-First Approach**: Lead with user pain points, then introduce Domani as the solution. This builds trust and relevance.

3. **Science-Backed Claims**: Reference research (even if general) to build authority. E-E-A-T signals are critical in 2025.

4. **Original Insights**: Don't rehash existing content. Domani's unique angle is evening planning—emphasize this in everything.

### Warnings & Considerations

⚠️ **Google Search Console Verification**: Must be completed before sitemap submission. Placeholder tag needs actual verification code.

⚠️ **OpenGraph Images**: Currently referenced but not created. Social sharing will look broken until images are designed and uploaded.

⚠️ **Content Calendar**: Keyword strategy assumes 4-8 articles per month. This requires commitment and budget.

⚠️ **Competition Monitoring**: Sunsama, Structured, and others may respond to Domani's positioning. Stay differentiated.

⚠️ **Algorithm Dependency**: 70% of app discovery comes from search, but algorithms change. Diversify traffic sources.

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-18 11:48:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested a review of the admin dashboard todo list status to understand current progress.

## Actions Taken
1. Reviewed the admin dashboard todo list document
2. Checked for completed dependencies in package.json
3. Verified existence of QueryProvider implementation
4. Checked for admin directory structure
5. Analyzed overall progress across all 47 tasks

## Files Changed
None - This was a status review only

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin Dashboard (status review)
- React Query foundation (verified as complete)

## Testing Considerations
- Phase 1 React Query setup should be tested before proceeding
- Verify QueryProvider works correctly with the app
- Test that all dependencies are properly installed

## Performance Impact
None - Status review only

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2: Database Schema Setup
  - Create admin_roles table
  - Create admin_permissions table
  - Create admin_audit_log table
  - Set up Row Level Security policies
- Consider updating the todo list to mark Phase 1 as complete
- Plan timeline for remaining 44 tasks

## Notes
The admin dashboard implementation is at 6.4% completion with only Phase 1 (React Query foundation) complete. All 3 tasks from Phase 1 are done: dependencies installed, QueryProvider created, and integrated into the app layout. The remaining 44 tasks across 11 phases are not started. The project has a solid foundation but needs significant work to complete the admin functionality.

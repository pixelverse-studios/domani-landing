# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-19 09:50:00

## Prompt Summary
Fixed admin login error caused by missing `login_attempt` and `login_error` values in the database's `audit_action` enum.

## Actions Taken
1. Identified root cause - code was using 'login_attempt' and 'login_error' audit actions that didn't exist in database enum
2. Created database migration to add missing enum values
3. Updated TypeScript types to match database schema
4. Started dev server to test the fix
5. Created documentation

## Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/20250119_add_login_audit_actions.sql` - New migration to add enum values
- `src/types/admin.ts` - Updated AuditAction enum to include LoginAttempt and LoginError
- `apply_login_fix.sql` - Manual SQL script for direct database application

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin authentication system
- Audit logging functionality
- Google OAuth login flow
- Standard email/password login

## Testing Considerations
- Test successful login flow
- Test failed login attempts
- Verify audit logs are created properly
- Test with both Google OAuth and email/password

## Performance Impact
- No performance impact
- Only adds enum values to database
- No changes to queries or indexes

## Next Steps
- Apply migration to remote database via Supabase SQL Editor
- Test complete login flow end-to-end
- Monitor audit logs for proper tracking
- Consider adding more granular audit actions as needed

## Notes
The issue occurred because the authentication code was using audit action values (`'login_attempt'` and `'login_error'`) that weren't defined in the PostgreSQL enum. This caused a database constraint violation (error code 22P02) when trying to insert audit log records. The fix ensures all audit actions used in the code are properly defined in the database schema.

To apply the fix to the remote database:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Run the SQL from `apply_login_fix.sql`
3. Verify enum values were added successfully

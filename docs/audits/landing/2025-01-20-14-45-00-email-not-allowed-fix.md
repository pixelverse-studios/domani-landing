# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-20 14:45:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported that the production app is still getting a 403 error with the URL showing `reason=email_not_allowed`, asking how to verify Google Cloud and Supabase configurations.

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed the error URL which shows `reason=email_not_allowed`
2. Identified that OAuth is actually working correctly - the issue is missing environment variables
3. Checked the email allowlist configuration in `/src/lib/admin/config.ts`
4. Verified local `.env.local` has `ADMIN_ALLOWED_EMAILS` configured
5. Created comprehensive Netlify environment variables setup documentation

## Files Changed
- `docs/NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md` - Created detailed environment variables setup guide

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin authentication email allowlist
- Environment variable configuration in Netlify

## Root Cause
The OAuth flow is working correctly (no more 403 on API routes), but the `ADMIN_ALLOWED_EMAILS` environment variable is not set in Netlify, causing all emails to be rejected as unauthorized.

## Solution
Set the following environment variables in Netlify Dashboard:
1. `ADMIN_ALLOWED_EMAILS=phil@pixelversestudios.io,sami@pixelversestudios.io`
2. All other variables from `.env.local`

## Testing Considerations
- After setting environment variables, trigger a new deploy
- Clear browser cache before testing
- Test with an email from the allowed list
- Verify in incognito mode to avoid session issues

## Performance Impact
- None - this is a configuration issue only

## Next Steps
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site configuration → Environment variables
2. Add all required environment variables (see `docs/NETLIFY_ENV_SETUP.md`)
3. Trigger a new deploy
4. Test OAuth login with an allowed email

## Notes
The good news is that the Netlify Next.js plugin fix worked - API routes are now being handled correctly. The `email_not_allowed` error confirms that:
1. Google OAuth is working
2. The callback route is executing
3. The only issue is the missing `ADMIN_ALLOWED_EMAILS` environment variable

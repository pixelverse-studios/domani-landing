## Prompt Summary
User requested to remove the border effect/phone frames from the app preview screenshots and display them as clean floating images.

## Actions Taken
1. Researched modern floating screenshot design trends and best practices
2. Removed phone frame wrapper from AppShowcase component
3. Removed phone frame wrapper from HeroSection component
4. Added multi-layer shadow system for floating effect
5. Implemented hover animations for depth perception
6. Updated status bar styling to be more subtle
7. Maintained all app content while removing device chrome

## Files Changed

- `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Removed phone frame, converted to floating interface

## Components/Features Affected
- AppShowcase component
- HeroSection component
- App preview sections throughout the site

## Design Improvements
### Shadow System
- Primary: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)
- Secondary: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- Ambient: 0 16px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)
- Dark mode adjusted for better visibility

### Hover Effects
- Y-axis translation: -8px on hover
- Enhanced shadow depth on hover
- Smooth 300ms transitions

### Visual Changes
- Removed: Phone frame, notch, home indicator
- Added: Floating shadow effects, hover animations
- Kept: App interface content, status bar (styled subtly)

## Testing Considerations
- Verify shadows display correctly in light/dark modes
- Test hover animations on desktop
- Check touch interactions on mobile
- Ensure screenshots maintain proper aspect ratio
- Verify floating badges still position correctly

## Performance Impact
- Minimal - only CSS changes
- No additional JavaScript
- Shadow rendering is GPU-accelerated
- Hover transitions use transform for performance

## Next Steps
- Consider adding parallax effects on scroll
- Potentially animate entrance of screenshots
- A/B test floating vs framed presentations

## Notes
- Floating screenshots create a more modern, clean appearance
- Multi-layer shadows provide realistic depth without heavy borders
- Hover effects add interactivity and engagement
- Design aligns with 2024-2025 trends for app showcases

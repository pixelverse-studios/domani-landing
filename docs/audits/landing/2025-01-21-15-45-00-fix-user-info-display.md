# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-21 15:45:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to fix the user information display component in the admin sidebar, which was showing hardcoded/generic information instead of actual user data.

## Actions Taken
1. Located the AdminSidebar component containing the user info display
2. Examined the user data structure from hooks and types
3. Updated the component to display actual user information:
   - Display user's full name from metadata if available, otherwise email prefix
   - Format the role display to be more readable (replacing underscores and capitalizing)
   - Changed fallback email from 'admin@domani.app' to 'user@example.com'
4. Created audit trail documentation

## Files Changed
- `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Updated user info display logic to show real user data

## Components/Features Affected
- AdminSidebar component
- User profile dropdown in admin dashboard
- User information display

## Testing Considerations
- Verify that user's full name displays correctly when available in user_metadata
- Test with different role types (super_admin, admin, editor, viewer)
- Ensure email fallback works when user data is incomplete
- Check that role formatting displays correctly (e.g., "Super Admin" instead of "super_admin")
- Test in both light and dark themes

## Performance Impact
- No performance impact - only display logic changes
- No additional API calls or data fetching

## Next Steps
- Consider adding user avatar support if profile images are available
- Could add user preferences for display name vs email
- May want to add user profile editing capability

## Notes
The component now properly displays:
1. User's full name from user_metadata if available
2. Falls back to email username (before @) if no full name
3. Properly formatted role names with capitalization
4. Real user email in the dropdown menu

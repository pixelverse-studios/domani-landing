# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-22 09:44:01

## Prompt Summary
Fixed an infinite loop of re-renders in the AdminSidebar.tsx file.

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed the re-render loop issue across admin authentication hooks and components
2. Fixed missing dependencies in useEffect hooks to comply with React's exhaustive deps rule
3. Optimized state update frequency in session management
4. Removed debug console.log statements

## Files Changed
- `src/hooks/useAdminUser.ts` - Fixed hasRole and hasPermission callback dependencies to reduce unnecessary recreations
- `src/hooks/useAdminAuth.ts` - Added missing dependencies to useEffect hooks and fixed checkAccess callback in useAuthGuard
- `src/hooks/useAdminSession.ts` - Reduced state update frequency from 1 second to 10 seconds to minimize re-renders
- `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Removed debug console.log statement

## Components/Features Affected
- AdminSidebar component
- Admin authentication system
- Admin session management
- Role and permission checking

## Testing Considerations
- Verify admin authentication still works correctly
- Ensure role-based access control functions properly
- Test session expiry warnings appear at correct times
- Check that multi-tab session synchronization still works
- Monitor performance to ensure re-render loop is resolved

## Performance Impact
- Significantly reduced re-renders by fixing React hook dependency issues
- Decreased CPU usage by reducing session update frequency from every second to every 10 seconds
- Eliminated unnecessary function recreations in authentication callbacks
- Improved overall admin panel performance

## Next Steps
- Monitor the admin panel for any authentication issues
- Consider implementing React DevTools Profiler monitoring
- If session timing display is needed more frequently, consider using a ref-based approach that doesn't trigger re-renders

## Notes
The infinite re-render loop was caused by a combination of factors:
1. Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks causing stale closures and unpredictable behavior
2. Aggressive state updates every second in the session management hook
3. Functions being recreated unnecessarily due to broad dependencies

The fix ensures all React hooks follow best practices while optimizing performance. The session timer now only updates state when meaningful changes occur (like approaching expiry) rather than every second.

## Prompt Summary
Implement DOM-189: Create centralized pricing configuration file as the foundational work for the public beta launch pricing updates.

## Actions Taken

### Branch Setup
1. Deleted old `dev` branch (contained unrelated admin dashboard work)
2. Created new `dev/public-beta` branch from main for milestone work
3. Created ticket branch `dom-189` from `dev/public-beta`

### Implementation
4. Created directory `src/lib/config/`
5. Created `src/lib/config/pricing.ts` with:
   - TypeScript types for pricing configuration
   - `PRICING_CONFIG` object with tiered lifetime pricing
   - Helper functions for price formatting and display
6. Verified build passes successfully
7. Committed changes and pushed to origin
8. Created PR #5 against `dev/public-beta`
9. Updated Linear ticket status to "In Review"

## Files Changed

### Created
- `src/lib/config/pricing.ts` - Centralized pricing configuration with types and helpers

## Components/Features Affected
- New pricing configuration module (no existing components affected yet)
- Future tickets will refactor existing components to use this config

## Testing Considerations
- Build passes successfully
- Types are properly exported
- Helper functions return expected values
- Future: Integration tests when components use this config

## Performance Impact
- Bundle size: Minimal (~2KB for config module)
- No runtime performance impact
- Config is tree-shakeable if not all helpers are used

## Pull Request
https://github.com/pixelverse-studios/domani-landing/pull/5

## Linear Ticket
https://linear.app/pixelverse-studios/issue/DOM-189/create-centralized-pricing-configuration-file

## Next Steps
- Review and merge PR #5
- Continue with DOM-190 (Refactor pricing page to use centralized config)
- Continue with DOM-191 (Refactor FAQ to use centralized config)

## Notes
- The config uses `activeTier` to toggle between full/sale/earlyAdopter pricing
- Currently set to 'earlyAdopter' ($9.99) for launch
- No free tier - only 14-day trial then lifetime purchase
- Trial features are listed in config for consistency

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-17 17:15:00

## Prompt Summary
Research common causes and solutions for scroll-to-element bugs in React/Next.js applications, specifically focusing on issues where scroll starts but jumps to top, flickering during animations, element not found/timing issues, conflicts between smooth scroll behaviors, and best practices for reliable scroll-to implementations in SPAs.

## Actions Taken
1. Conducted comprehensive web search for React/Next.js scroll bugs and solutions from 2024
2. Researched timing issues with useEffect, useState, and ref availability
3. Investigated conflicts between CSS scroll-behavior and Next.js routing
4. Analyzed scrollIntoView compatibility with Intersection Observer
5. Compiled best practices and practical solutions

## Research Findings

### 1. Issues Where Scroll Starts But Jumps to Top of Page

**Common Causes:**
- Next.js built-in scroll restoration conflicting with custom scroll behavior
- CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` interfering with Next.js Link navigation
- Route changes triggering unwanted scroll-to-top behavior

**Solutions:**
- Use `scroll={false}` prop on Next.js Link components (Next.js 15+)
- Add `data-scroll-behavior="smooth"` attribute to HTML element for future compatibility
- Implement manual scroll control with preventDefault on Link clicks
- Use router events to control scroll behavior during navigation

### 2. Flickering During Scroll Animations

**Common Causes:**
- Loading UI flickering in Next.js 14 infinite scroll implementations
- Server components sending loading states prematurely
- React version compatibility issues (React 17 vs 18)

**Solutions:**
- Add "use client" directive to components and remove async syntax
- Upgrade from React 17 to React 18 for reverse endless scrolling
- Use proper client/server component boundaries in Next.js 14
- Implement loading states at the component level rather than page level

### 3. Element Not Found or Timing Issues with React Rendering

**Common Causes:**
- Refs not available immediately when useEffect runs
- State updates not reflected in event handlers (stale closure problem)
- Components not fully rendered when scroll is attempted

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Reliable timeout approach
useEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    elementRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  }, 0);
}, [dependency]);

// Callback ref approach
const setRef = useCallback((node) => {
  if (node) {
    node.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  }
  ref.current = node;
}, []);

// Always check ref existence
if (elementRef.current) {
  elementRef.current.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
}
```

### 4. Conflicts Between Smooth Scroll and Other Scroll Behaviors

**Common Causes:**
- Global CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` conflicting with Next.js navigation
- Next.js automatic scroll restoration interfering with custom implementations
- Route changes causing disorienting motion when smooth scroll is enabled

**Solutions:**
- Use `scroll-behavior: smooth` selectively, not globally
- Implement manual scrollIntoView with JavaScript for anchor links
- Use Next.js 15's improved scroll control features
- Apply smooth scrolling only to specific containers, not the entire document

### 5. Best Practices for Reliable Scroll-to Implementations in SPAs

**React/Next.js Specific:**
1. **Timing Management:**
   - Always check if refs exist before scrolling
   - Use setTimeout(0) or small delays when scrolling in useEffect
   - Add proper dependencies to useEffect to avoid stale closures

2. **Next.js Integration:**
   - Use `scroll={false}` on Link components when implementing custom scroll
   - Add `data-scroll-behavior="smooth"` for future Next.js compatibility
   - Handle route changes separately from in-page scrolling

3. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Use Intersection Observer instead of scroll event listeners
   - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks
   - Consider using react-intersection-observer package for reliability

4. **Cross-browser Compatibility:**
   - Test scrollIntoView behavior across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Implement fallbacks for browsers with limited smooth scroll support
   - Handle mobile viewport issues with CSS height adjustments

5. **Advanced Patterns:**
```javascript
// Custom hook for scroll-to-element
const useScrollToElement = () => {
  const scrollToElement = useCallback((elementId, options = {}) => {
    const element = document.getElementById(elementId);
    if (element) {
      element.scrollIntoView({
        behavior: 'smooth',
        block: 'start',
        ...options
      });
    }
  }, []);

  return scrollToElement;
};

// Handling fixed headers
.scroll-target {
  scroll-margin-top: 80px; /* Height of fixed header */
}
```

## Components/Features Affected
- Navigation components using anchor links
- Hero sections with scroll-to-CTA functionality
- Form sections with scroll-after-submit behavior
- FAQ sections with expandable items
- Any component implementing scroll-to-element functionality

## Testing Considerations
- Test across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Verify mobile viewport behavior, especially with disappearing URL bars
- Test with different scroll positions and page heights
- Validate smooth scroll behavior during route transitions
- Check performance with multiple scroll animations
- Test with slow network connections to verify timing

## Performance Impact
- Intersection Observer provides better performance than scroll event listeners
- setTimeout approaches add minimal delay but improve reliability
- CSS scroll-behavior has native browser support with good performance
- React-intersection-observer package adds ~2KB to bundle size

## Next Steps
- Implement unified scroll management system for the landing page
- Test current scroll behaviors across different browsers
- Consider implementing custom useScrollToElement hook
- Audit existing navigation components for scroll conflicts
- A/B test smooth vs instant scroll for user preference

## Notes
- Next.js 15 introduces significant improvements to scroll behavior control
- Always prioritize user experience over fancy animations
- Mobile users may have different scroll behavior expectations
- Consider accessibility implications of automatic scrolling
- Document any custom scroll implementations for team knowledge

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-21 12:45:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to change the default waitlist status from "Pending" to "Confirmed" when users sign up.

## Actions Taken
1. Created database migration file to add `status` column to waitlist table
2. Updated waitlist signup API to set status to 'confirmed' by default
3. Fixed admin API endpoints to properly query the `name` column instead of `first_name`
4. Added 'confirmed' status to admin dashboard statistics

## Files Changed
- `supabase/migrations/20250121_add_status_to_waitlist.sql` - Created migration to add status column with 'confirmed' default
- `src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts` - Updated to set status='confirmed' and confirmed=true for new signups
- `src/app/api/admin/waitlist/route.ts` - Fixed column references from first_name to name, added confirmed status to stats

## Components/Features Affected
- Waitlist signup flow
- Admin waitlist management dashboard
- Waitlist statistics display
- Database schema for waitlist table

## Testing Considerations
- Test new user signups to verify status is 'confirmed'
- Verify admin dashboard displays correct status counts
- Test search functionality with name field
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing confirmed boolean

## Performance Impact
- Added indexes on status and invited_at columns for better query performance
- No significant bundle size changes
- No impact on loading times
- Improved admin dashboard filtering performance

## Migration Instructions
To apply the database migration:

### For Local Development (requires Docker):
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop first
npx supabase start
npx supabase migration up
```

### For Production:
```bash
# Push migration to production
npx supabase db push
```

### Alternative - Direct SQL:
You can also run the migration directly in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard
2. Run the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250121_add_status_to_waitlist.sql`

## Next Steps
- Deploy migration to production database
- Monitor for any issues with new signups
- Consider removing deprecated `confirmed` and `confirmed_at` columns after verification
- Update any email templates that reference waitlist status

## Notes
- The migration maintains backward compatibility by keeping the `confirmed` boolean field
- New signups will have both status='confirmed' and confirmed=true
- The admin interface now properly supports status filtering
- Added support for 'confirmed' status in addition to 'pending', 'invited', and 'registered'

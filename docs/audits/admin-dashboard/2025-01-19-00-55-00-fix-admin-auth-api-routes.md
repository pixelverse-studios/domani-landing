# Audit Log - Admin Dashboard - 2025-01-19 00:55:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported 404 errors when accessing /admin/login. The admin authentication API routes (/api/admin/auth/verify) were returning 404 errors, preventing the admin login functionality from working.

## Actions Taken
1. Identified missing API routes for admin authentication
2. Created /api/admin/auth/verify/route.ts
3. Created /api/admin/auth/login/route.ts
4. Created /api/admin/auth/refresh/route.ts
5. Created /api/admin/auth/logout/route.ts
6. Created /app/admin/page.tsx (admin dashboard)
7. Created /lib/supabase/server.ts for Supabase server client
8. Installed @supabase/ssr package
9. Added createAdminAuditLog export to audit module
10. Fixed token verification logic in API routes

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/admin/auth/verify/route.ts` - Created API endpoint for session verification
- `src/app/api/admin/auth/login/route.ts` - Created API endpoint for admin login
- `src/app/api/admin/auth/refresh/route.ts` - Created API endpoint for token refresh
- `src/app/api/admin/auth/logout/route.ts` - Created API endpoint for logout
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Created admin dashboard page
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` - Created Supabase server client
- `src/lib/admin/audit.ts` - Added createAdminAuditLog function

## Components/Features Affected
- Admin authentication flow
- Admin login page
- Admin dashboard
- Session management
- Token verification
- Audit logging system

## Testing Considerations
- Test login with valid credentials
- Test session persistence across page refreshes
- Test token expiration and refresh
- Test logout functionality
- Test unauthorized access redirects
- Test audit log creation
- Browser testing: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- Test mobile responsiveness

## Performance Impact
- Added JWT verification overhead to protected routes
- Database queries for user verification
- Cookie management for sessions
- Minimal impact on bundle size (server-side code)
- No impact on initial page load (lazy loaded)

## Next Steps
- Configure admin user accounts in Supabase
- Test complete authentication flow with real credentials
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Add 2FA support for admin accounts
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add admin user management UI
- Set up monitoring for failed login attempts

## Notes
- The authentication system uses JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration
- Refresh tokens are valid for 7 days
- All authentication actions are logged to the audit system
- The system supports role-based access control
- Session cookies are httpOnly and secure in production
- Error messages are intentionally vague for security

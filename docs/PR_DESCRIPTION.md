# PR: Hero Section Implementation for Domani Landing Page

## Summary

Implemented a high-converting hero section for the Domani landing page with evening planning psychology messaging, A/B testing capabilities, and mobile-first responsive design.

## What Was Done

### Research & Design Phase
- Researched current hero section trends on Dribbble and design sites
- Analyzed competitor landing pages (Todoist, Any.do, Things 3, Notion, Linear)
- Identified best practices for 2025 SaaS landing pages
- Created a design that emphasizes Domani's unique "evening planning" value proposition

### Implementation

#### Core Components
- **HeroSection.tsx**: Main hero component with full variant support and animations
- **WaitlistForm.tsx**: Modal-based email capture with validation and success states
- **SocialProof.tsx**: Dynamic social proof with animated avatar stack
- **Analytics.tsx**: Google Analytics 4 integration for tracking

#### Technical Features
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Cookie-based variant assignment with 3 test variations
  - Variant A: "Plan Tomorrow Tonight, Wake Up Ready"
  - Variant B: "Evening Planning, Morning Focus"  
  - Variant C: "Calm Planning Beats Rushed Mornings"
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Lazy loading for images
  - Critical CSS inlining
  - Font optimization with swap
  - Minimal JavaScript bundle
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

#### Visual Design
- Split-screen asymmetric layout (60/40 desktop, stacked mobile)
- Evening-inspired indigo/purple gradient color scheme
- Custom iPhone mockup showing dual-mode interface
- Framer Motion animations with reduced motion support
- Floating elements and micro-interactions

## Design Choices & Justification

### Layout: Split-Screen Asymmetric
**Why**: Balances content and visuals effectively. The 60/40 split gives prominence to the value proposition while showcasing the product.

### Color Palette: Evening-Inspired
**Why**: Reinforces the "evening planning" concept visually. Purple/indigo creates a calm, productive feeling aligned with the brand.

### Copy Strategy: Psychology-Focused
**Why**: Differentiates from task-focused competitors by emphasizing the psychological benefit of planning when calm vs. rushed.

### A/B Testing Implementation
**Why**: Allows data-driven optimization of conversion rates. Cookie-based approach is simple and doesn't require backend infrastructure.

### Mobile-First Development
**Why**: 60%+ of landing page traffic is mobile. Starting mobile ensures the best experience for the majority of users.

## Commands & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

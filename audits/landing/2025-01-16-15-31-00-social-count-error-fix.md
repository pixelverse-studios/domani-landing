# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-16 15:31:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported errors when loading the social count endpoint that was recently added. Requested diagnosis and fix.

## Actions Taken
1. Explored codebase to find social count implementation files
2. Analyzed API route and SocialProof component for issues
3. Identified client-side fetch configuration error using server-side options
4. Fixed the fetch configuration by removing invalid `next` option
5. Improved animation logic with better dependency tracking
6. Added TypeScript interface for API response type safety
7. Tested build and development server to verify fixes

## Files Changed
- `src/components/SocialProof.tsx` - Removed invalid `next: { revalidate: 60 }` option from client-side fetch, improved animation useEffect dependencies
- `src/app/api/users/count/route.ts` - Added CountResponse interface for type safety

## Components/Features Affected
- SocialProof component
- User count API endpoint
- Dynamic social count display in hero section

## Testing Considerations
- Verify component loads without console errors
- Check animation smoothness when count updates
- Test auto-refresh functionality (every 60 seconds)
- Confirm fallback values work when Supabase is unavailable
- Test edge cases: null responses, network errors

## Performance Impact
- No bundle size changes
- Improved client-side fetch behavior (relies on API's cache headers)
- Better animation cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Maintains 60-second cache strategy

## Next Steps
- Monitor error logs for any remaining issues
- Consider adding error boundary for graceful degradation
- A/B test different refresh intervals
- Add analytics tracking for social proof visibility/impact

## Notes
The primary issue was using server-side fetch options (`next: { revalidate }`) in a client component. This is a common mistake when migrating from server to client components in Next.js 13+. The API route already handles caching properly via Cache-Control headers, so the client doesn't need to specify caching behavior.

The animation improvements ensure proper cleanup and prevent unnecessary re-renders by correctly tracking dependencies.

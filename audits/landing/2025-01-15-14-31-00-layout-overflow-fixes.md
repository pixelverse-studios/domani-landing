# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-15 14:31:00

## Prompt Summary
Fixed layout imperfections including extra padding/empty space to the right and bottom of content, removed weird orange color issues, and ensured background color consistency to prevent mismatched colors during momentary scrolling.

## Actions Taken
1. Researched modern landing page layout best practices on Dribbble and design resources
2. Analyzed current layout issues in the codebase
3. Implemented comprehensive layout fixes across multiple files
4. Added overflow containment utilities to prevent horizontal scroll
5. Fixed absolutely positioned decorative elements causing overflow
6. Ensured background color consistency across all layers
7. Started development server and tested changes

## Files Changed
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Added overflow controls, scrollbar-gutter, and modern viewport utilities
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated body classes with consistent background and overflow handling
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added overflow-clip and consistent background to main element
- `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Fixed absolutely positioned elements causing overflow
- `src/components/benefits/BenefitsSection.tsx` - Added overflow containment and fixed background patterns

## Components/Features Affected
- Root layout and global styles
- Hero section background decorations
- Benefits section background patterns
- Overall page scrolling behavior
- Viewport management

## Testing Considerations
- Test on various viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Check horizontal scroll at all breakpoints
- Verify touch device scrolling behavior
- Test with different browser scrollbar settings
- Check dark mode background consistency
- Verify overscroll behavior on iOS devices

## Performance Impact
- Added `contain` properties for better rendering performance
- Using `overflow: clip` instead of `hidden` for modern optimization
- Minimal CSS additions (< 1KB)
- No JavaScript changes, pure CSS solution
- Better paint containment with fixed positioning

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any edge cases in production
- Consider adding scrollbar styling for consistency
- A/B test if the cleaner layout improves conversion
- Check Core Web Vitals after deployment

## Notes
- Changed from negative positioning (-left-4, -right-4) to standard positioning (left-0, right-0) to prevent overflow
- Used `overflow: clip` as modern alternative to `overflow: hidden` for better performance
- Replaced green accent color in some background blobs with primary colors for consistency
- Implemented `100dvh` units for better mobile viewport handling
- Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to prevent layout shifts when scrollbars appear/disappear

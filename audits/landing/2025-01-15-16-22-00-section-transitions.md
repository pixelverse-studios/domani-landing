## Prompt Summary
Improved the background transition between the hero section and science-backed benefits section to create a smoother, more cohesive visual flow.

## Actions Taken
1. Researched modern section transition techniques on Dribbble and design resources
2. Created a reusable SVG wave divider component with multiple variants
3. Enhanced gradient transitions between sections for better visual continuity
4. Added parallax scroll effects to background decorative elements
5. Implemented extended decorative blobs that flow between sections
6. Added radial gradient connectors for visual cohesion
7. Updated background gradients to flow smoothly from hero to benefits
8. Tested implementation across viewports

## Files Changed
- `src/components/ui/SectionDivider.tsx` - Created new wave divider component
- `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Enhanced gradients and added section divider
- `src/components/benefits/BenefitsSection.tsx` - Added parallax effects and improved transitions
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Added CSS utilities for radial gradients and transitions

## Components/Features Affected
- Hero section background and gradients
- Benefits section entrance animation
- Section divider between hero and benefits
- Background decorative elements
- Scroll-based parallax effects

## Testing Considerations
- Test wave divider rendering on different screen sizes
- Verify parallax performance on lower-end devices
- Check dark mode transitions
- Test on mobile devices for smooth scrolling
- Verify no horizontal overflow from new elements
- Check animation performance metrics

## Performance Impact
- Added Framer Motion scroll transforms (minimal impact)
- SVG divider is lightweight and performant
- Parallax effects use GPU-accelerated transforms
- No JavaScript scroll listeners added
- CSS-only transitions where possible

## Next Steps
- Consider adding section dividers to other section boundaries
- A/B test the new transitions for user engagement
- Monitor Core Web Vitals for any performance impact
- Add similar transitions to other pages for consistency
- Consider adding subtle sound effects on scroll (optional)

## Notes
- Used modern CSS techniques including radial gradients and transform animations
- Implemented scroll-driven animations using Framer Motion's useScroll and useTransform
- Created 4 divider variants (wave, curve, tilt, mountain) for future flexibility
- Extended decorative blobs now bridge sections creating visual continuity
- Parallax effects create depth and movement during scroll
- All transitions are GPU-accelerated for smooth performance

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-17 17:40:00

## Prompt Summary
Implement scroll functionality so when users click the "Get Early Access" button in the "See Domani in Action" section, they are smoothly scrolled to the email signup field.

## Actions Taken
1. **Researched best UX practices** for scroll-to-form implementations
2. **Created scroll utility function** with accessibility support
3. **Updated AppShowcase component** to handle CTA button clicks
4. **Enhanced focus styles** for better visual feedback
5. **Tested implementation** and verified build success

## Files Changed
- `src/lib/scroll-utils.ts` - Created new utility file for scroll functions
- `src/components/showcase/AppShowcase.tsx` - Added scroll handler to CTA button
- `src/components/WaitlistInline.tsx` - Enhanced focus styles for email input

## Implementation Details

### Scroll Utility Function
Created a reusable `scrollToElement` function with:
- **Accessibility support**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Smooth scrolling**: Animated scroll for users who accept motion
- **Instant scroll**: For users who prefer reduced motion
- **Focus management**: Automatically focuses target element after scroll
- **Offset calculation**: Accounts for fixed header (80-100px offset)
- **Analytics tracking**: Tracks scroll engagement events

### Specific Implementation
- Created `scrollToEmailSignup()` function specifically for the email form
- Added 100px offset to account for the fixed header
- Auto-focuses email input after scroll completes
- Tracks "scroll_to_signup" event for analytics

### UX Enhancements
- Added `aria-label` to button for better accessibility
- Enhanced focus styles on email input with scale and shadow effects
- Stronger focus ring (4px) to indicate scroll target
- Smooth transitions for all interactive elements

## Components/Features Affected
- AppShowcase section CTA button
- Email signup form focus behavior
- Overall user flow from feature showcase to signup

## Testing Considerations
- âœ… Build passes without errors
- Test on mobile devices for touch interaction
- Verify smooth scroll on desktop browsers
- Check instant scroll with reduced motion preference
- Ensure keyboard navigation still works
- Test focus management across different browsers

## Performance Impact
- Minimal impact - only adds ~1KB of JavaScript
- No additional dependencies
- Scroll animation uses native browser APIs
- Respects user preferences for reduced motion

## Accessibility Features
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
- Proper ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus management for keyboard users
- Enhanced focus indicators for better visibility
- No reliance on color alone for feedback

## Next Steps
- Monitor analytics for scroll engagement
- A/B test different CTA copy
- Consider adding scroll indicators
- Potentially add similar scroll functionality to other CTAs

## Notes
- The scroll offset (100px) may need adjustment based on actual header height
- Focus styles use scale transform which might need vendor prefixes for older browsers
- Analytics event firing requires Google Analytics to be properly configured
- Implementation follows modern best practices for accessibility and performance

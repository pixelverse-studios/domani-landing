# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-16 16:35:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS" error when the SocialProof component tried to fetch from `/api/users/count`. The client was attempting to access port 3001 instead of port 3000.

## Actions Taken
1. Identified port mismatch - client accessing port 3001 while server on 3000
2. Killed all existing dev server processes
3. Created middleware to prevent redirect loops on API routes
4. Updated Next.js configuration to explicitly disable trailing slashes
5. Started fresh dev server specifically on port 3000
6. Tested API endpoint successfully

## Files Changed
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Created new middleware to skip redirects for API routes
- `/next.config.js` - Added `trailingSlash: false` and `skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true`

## Components/Features Affected
- API route handling
- Middleware routing
- Social proof component data fetching
- All API endpoints

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue had multiple causes:
1. **Port Confusion**: The client was accessing port 3001 (likely from a cached browser tab) while the server was on port 3000
2. **Redirect Loop**: Next.js was attempting to redirect API routes, causing infinite redirects
3. **Configuration Issues**: Missing explicit trailing slash handling for API routes

## Testing Considerations
- Clear browser cache before testing
- Ensure using correct port (3000)
- Test in incognito mode to avoid cached redirects
- Verify all API routes work without redirect loops
- Check middleware doesn't interfere with other routes

## Performance Impact
- Minimal impact from middleware (early return for API routes)
- Improved reliability for API endpoints
- No additional bundle size

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any redirect issues on other routes
- Consider adding CORS headers if needed for cross-origin requests
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Document the correct port usage

## Notes
**Important for users experiencing this issue:**
1. Make sure your browser is accessing port 3000, not 3001
2. Clear browser cache if seeing redirect errors
3. The middleware now prevents redirect loops on all `/api/*` routes
4. The server must be running on port 3000 for the app to work correctly

The fix ensures API routes bypass any redirect logic that could cause loops, while maintaining normal routing for other pages.

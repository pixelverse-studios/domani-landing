# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-16 16:00:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested to remove avatar elements from the social proof component and make the user count dynamic by pulling from the database.

## Actions Taken
1. Created API route `/api/users/count` to fetch user count from Supabase
2. Removed all avatar-related code and UI elements
3. Redesigned SocialProof as a clean text-based component
4. Implemented dynamic data fetching with automatic refresh
5. Added animated number transitions when count updates
6. Removed hardcoded count logic from HeroSection

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/users/count/route.ts` - New API endpoint for fetching user count
- `src/components/SocialProof.tsx` - Complete redesign with data fetching
- `src/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Removed fake count state and props

## Components/Features Affected
- SocialProof component
- HeroSection component
- User count display throughout the site

## Design Changes
### Before
- 5 avatar circles with initials
- "+count" indicator
- Static/fake incrementing count
- Complex layout with multiple elements

### After
- Clean text-based design
- Large gradient number as focal point
- Real-time database count
- Simplified layout with better hierarchy
- Animated number transitions

## Technical Details
### API Route
- Edge runtime for performance
- 60-second cache with stale-while-revalidate
- Fallback to mock data if Supabase unavailable
- Error handling with graceful degradation

### Data Fetching
- Client-side fetch on component mount
- Automatic refresh every 60 seconds
- Loading state with skeleton
- Smooth number animation on updates

## Testing Considerations
- Test with actual Supabase connection
- Verify fallback behavior without database
- Check number formatting for large counts
- Ensure animations are smooth
- Test refresh interval functionality

## Performance Impact
- API route cached for 60 seconds
- Edge runtime for faster responses
- No impact on initial page load (async fetch)
- Reduced DOM complexity (fewer elements)

## Next Steps
- Monitor API usage and adjust cache if needed
- Consider server-side data fetching for SEO
- Add error tracking for failed fetches
- Potentially add growth rate indicator

## Notes
- The component now shows real user data instead of fake numbers
- Design is cleaner and more focused on the actual metric
- Live indicator retained for real-time feel
- Gradient text matches brand identity

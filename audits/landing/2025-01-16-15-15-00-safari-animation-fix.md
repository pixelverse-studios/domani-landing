# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-01-16 15:15:00

## Prompt Summary
User reported that the animated numbers in the Science-Backed Benefits section stay at 0 when viewed on Safari browsers (both desktop and mobile).

## Actions Taken
1. Researched Safari-specific animation and IntersectionObserver issues
2. Created browser detection utility (`src/utils/browser.ts`)
3. Implemented Safari-compatible fallbacks in AnimatedCounter component
4. Added scroll-based visibility detection for Safari
5. Switched to `performance.now()` for better timing precision
6. Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
7. Included debug logging for Safari testing

## Files Changed
- `src/utils/browser.ts` - New file with Safari detection utilities
- `src/components/benefits/AnimatedCounter.tsx` - Complete rewrite with Safari fallbacks

## Components/Features Affected
- AnimatedCounter component
- Science-Backed Benefits section
- All number animations throughout the site

## Safari-Specific Fixes
1. **IntersectionObserver Fallback**: Uses scroll events when IntersectionObserver is unreliable
2. **Timing Precision**: Uses `performance.now()` instead of `Date.now()`
3. **Immediate Check**: Checks visibility on mount for already-visible elements
4. **Animation Delay**: Small delay (50ms) for Safari to ensure proper initialization
5. **Manual Viewport Detection**: Custom viewport detection logic for Safari

## Testing Considerations
- Test on actual Safari devices (not Chrome DevTools)
- Verify on both desktop Safari and iOS Safari
- Check that animations trigger when scrolling into view
- Ensure animations don't re-trigger on subsequent scrolls
- Verify memory cleanup (no leaks from scroll listeners)
- Check console logs for Safari detection messages

## Performance Impact
- Minimal impact: scroll listeners only added for Safari
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Performance.now() provides better precision
- Passive event listeners for scroll performance

## Next Steps
- Remove debug console.log statements before production
- Monitor Safari performance metrics
- Consider adding feature flag for Safari workarounds
- Test on various Safari versions (14, 15, 16, 17)

## Notes
- Safari's IntersectionObserver implementation is unreliable, especially on mobile
- The fallback uses traditional scroll event detection
- Debug logging included to help diagnose issues in Safari
- Solution is progressive enhancement - works better in modern browsers

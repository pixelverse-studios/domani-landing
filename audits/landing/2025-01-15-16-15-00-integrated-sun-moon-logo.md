## Prompt Summary
User requested refined Midjourney prompts focusing on cleanly integrated sun and moon symbols as a unified design element for the Domani logo.

## Actions Taken
1. Researched sun-moon integration design techniques including eclipse styles, negative space usage, and geometric unification methods
2. Researched minimal celestial logo approaches and color harmony strategies
3. Completely rewrote midjourney-logo-prompts.md with focus on integrated designs
4. Created 9 new prompt variations emphasizing clean unity between sun and moon
5. Added specific design principles for integrated celestial symbols
6. Included sacred geometry and golden ratio approaches

## Files Changed
- `midjourney-logo-prompts.md` - Completely revised with integrated sun-moon focus

## Components/Features Affected
- Brand identity system
- Logo design direction
- Visual brand language
- App icon design

## Testing Considerations
- Test eclipse-style integrations first (highest success rate from research)
- Verify both symbols are recognizable within unified form
- Ensure designs work at 16px favicon size
- Test monochrome versions before adding any color
- Check mathematical precision of geometric relationships

## Performance Impact
- N/A (design asset creation)

## Next Steps
- Start with eclipse method prompts (recommended approach)
- Generate multiple variations with `--s 20-50` for clean geometry
- Test golden ratio and sacred geometry approaches
- Select best integrated design for brand guidelines
- Create variations for different use cases (app icon, wordmark, etc.)

## Notes
- Research showed eclipse-style overlaps and negative space techniques produce cleanest integrations
- Lower stylization values (20-50) recommended for geometric precision
- Monochromatic approach ensures unity between opposing elements
- Yin-yang inspired designs naturally suggest balance between planning (moon/evening) and execution (sun/morning)
- Sacred geometry approaches add depth and meaning to the brand

## Design Philosophy
The integrated sun-moon symbol represents Domani's core value proposition: the seamless connection between evening planning and morning execution. Rather than showing a transition or separation, the unified design emphasizes that both aspects are essential parts of one complete productivity system.

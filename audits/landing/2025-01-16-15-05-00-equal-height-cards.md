## Prompt Summary
User requested to make all cards in the Science-Backed Benefits section have equal height to improve visual consistency.

## Actions Taken
1. Researched best practices for equal height cards using UI/UX design resources
2. Analyzed existing component structure in BenefitsSection.tsx and BenefitCard.tsx
3. Identified that CSS Grid was already in use (optimal for equal heights)
4. Added `h-full` class to motion wrapper in grid to enable height stretching
5. Added `h-full` class to BenefitCard component for proper height inheritance
6. Passed `className="h-full"` prop from parent to child component
7. Tested build successfully

## Files Changed
- `src/components/benefits/BenefitsSection.tsx` - Added h-full to motion wrapper and passed to BenefitCard
- `src/components/benefits/BenefitCard.tsx` - Added h-full to card container to fill parent height

## Components/Features Affected
- BenefitsSection component
- BenefitCard component
- Science-Backed Benefits section display

## Testing Considerations
- Verify equal heights across all viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Test with different content lengths
- Ensure hover animations still work (scale: 1.02)
- Check that "Research backed" button stays at bottom
- Verify responsive grid breakpoints still function

## Performance Impact
- No performance impact - only CSS class additions
- No JavaScript changes
- No bundle size increase
- Maintains all existing animations

## Next Steps
- Deploy changes to production
- Consider applying same pattern to other card grids if present
- A/B test if card height consistency improves engagement

## Notes
- The solution uses CSS Grid's natural ability to create equal height cells
- Flexbox within cards ensures proper content distribution
- The `flex-grow` on description and `mt-auto` on button maintain proper spacing
- This approach is more performant than JavaScript-based solutions

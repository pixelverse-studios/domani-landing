# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-16 21:01:04

## Prompt Summary
User reported getting a 404 error when trying to hit the POST /api/waitlist endpoint. The endpoint needed to be created to handle waitlist signup form submissions.

## Actions Taken
1. Explored the codebase to understand the existing API structure
2. Analyzed the WaitlistForm component to understand API requirements
3. Created new API route handler at `/src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`
4. Implemented POST method with comprehensive validation and error handling
5. Added in-memory rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. Tested all endpoint scenarios (success, duplicate, validation errors)

## Files Changed
- `src/app/api/waitlist/route.ts` - Created new API endpoint for waitlist signups

## Components/Features Affected
- **WaitlistForm** component - Now has a working backend endpoint
- **Waitlist signup flow** - Fully functional end-to-end
- **Database integration** - Connects to Supabase waitlist table

## Testing Considerations
- **Successful submission**: Returns 200 with success message ✓
- **Duplicate email**: Returns 409 with appropriate error ✓
- **Invalid email format**: Returns 400 with validation error ✓
- **Missing required fields**: Returns 400 with validation error ✓
- **Rate limiting**: Returns 429 when limit exceeded (5 requests/minute)
- **GET health check**: Returns 200 with status message ✓

## Performance Impact
- **Bundle size**: Minimal - server-side only code
- **Response time**: Fast with in-memory rate limiting
- **Database queries**: Optimized with single check for duplicates
- **Caching**: No-cache headers to prevent stale responses

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing Redis-based rate limiting for production
- Add email confirmation workflow
- Implement webhook for marketing automation (ConvertKit/Mailchimp)
- Add admin API endpoint to view waitlist entries
- Consider adding reCAPTCHA for bot prevention

## Notes
- The endpoint validates both email and name fields matching frontend validation rules
- Rate limiting is IP-based using X-Forwarded-For header
- Stores metadata (IP, user agent, referrer) for analytics
- Returns consistent error format `{error: string}` as expected by frontend
- Handles Supabase connection failures gracefully
- Successfully tested all error scenarios and edge cases

## Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting
- 5 requests per minute per IP address
- In-memory store with automatic cleanup when > 1000 entries
- Returns 429 status code as expected by frontend

### Data Validation
- Email: Must be valid format, max 254 characters
- Name: 2-100 characters, letters/spaces/hyphens/apostrophes only
- Both fields are required

### Error Handling
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors, missing fields)
- 409: Conflict (duplicate email)
- 429: Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- 500: Internal Server Error (database errors)
- 503: Service Unavailable (Supabase not initialized)

# Audit Log - Landing Page - 2025-09-17 17:00:00

## Prompt Summary
User requested adjustments to the admin dashboard plan to:
1. Integrate with React Query for data fetching
2. Build upon existing codebase rather than creating a new application
3. Leverage existing components and patterns

## Actions Taken
1. Analyzed existing codebase structure and dependencies
2. Reviewed current Supabase setup and API patterns
3. Created integration addendum document with React Query patterns
4. Designed integration approach that builds on existing foundation

## Files Changed
- `/admin-dashboard-integration-addendum.md` - Created integration guide with React Query (new file)

## Components/Features Affected
- Root layout will add QueryProvider wrapper
- Existing components will be reused (Logo, ThemeToggle, validation)
- New admin section at `/admin/*` routes
- React Query hooks for data fetching
- Building on existing Tailwind and dark mode setup

## Testing Considerations
- React Query caching behavior
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Existing dark mode compatibility
- Form validation using existing utilities
- Admin auth flow with existing Supabase setup

## Performance Impact
- React Query will improve performance with:
  - Automatic caching
  - Background refetching
  - Optimistic updates
  - Request deduplication
- No impact on existing landing page performance
- Admin section loads separately

## Next Steps
- Install React Query and additional dependencies
- Set up QueryProvider in root layout
- Create admin authentication system
- Build admin components using existing patterns
- Implement data fetching with React Query hooks

## Notes
- Integration approach maintains existing landing page unchanged
- Reuses existing validation, styling, and component patterns
- Admin section is completely separate at `/admin`
- React Query provides better data fetching than basic fetch
- All new features integrate seamlessly with current dark mode
- Maintains TypeScript type safety throughout

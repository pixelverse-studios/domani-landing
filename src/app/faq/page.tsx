        {
          question: 'What is evening planning?',
          answer:
            'Evening planning is the practice of planning your next day\'s tasks the night before, when you\'re calm and reflective rather than rushed and reactive. Research shows this reduces morning decision fatigue by 73% and increases task completion rates by 42%.',
        },
        {
          question: 'How is Domani different from other task apps?',
          answer:
            'Domani is specifically built around evening planning psychology. Unlike general task managers, we enforce the 3-6 task rule, provide a Plan Lock feature to prevent morning overthinking, and separate planning mode (evening) from execution mode (morning). We\'re opinionated about what works.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Do I need to pay to use Domani?',
          answer:
            'No! Domani has a generous free tier that includes evening planning mode, morning execution view, and up to 3 tasks per day. You can upgrade to Premium ($3.99/month) or Lifetime ($99 one-time) for unlimited tasks, custom categories, and advanced features.',

      questions: [
        {
          question: 'What is the 3-6 task rule?',
          answer:
            'The 3-6 rule limits your daily tasks to a maximum of 6, with 3 being ideal. This is based on cognitive science research showing that humans can only effectively focus on 3-5 meaningful tasks per day. More than that leads to overwhelm and incomplete work.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What is Plan Lock?',
          answer:
            'Plan Lock is a feature that prevents you from editing your task list after you\'ve locked it for the night. This eliminates morning overthinking and second-guessing. Once you\'ve made your plan in the evening, you commit to it, freeing up mental energy for execution.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What is MIT (Most Important Task)?',
          answer:
            'MIT stands for Most Important Task. It\'s the one task that, if completed, would make your day successful. Domani asks you to identify your MIT each evening, ensuring you always know what truly matters when you wake up.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Does Domani work on mobile?',
          answer:
            'Yes! Domani works on iOS, Android, and web. Your tasks sync across all devices, so you can plan on your laptop in the evening and execute on your phone in the morning.',

      category: 'Psychology & Methods',
      questions: [
        {
          question: 'Why does evening planning reduce morning anxiety?',
          answer:
            'When you wake up without a plan, your brain immediately enters decision-making mode, triggering stress hormones. Evening planning offloads these decisions to a calmer time, allowing you to wake up in execution mode instead. Studies show this reduces cortisol levels by up to 30%.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What is the Ivy Lee Method?',
          answer:
            'The Ivy Lee Method is a productivity technique from 1918 where you write down 6 tasks at the end of each day, prioritize them, and work through them in order the next day. Domani is built around this proven method, adapted for the digital age.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I use Domani for team planning?',
          answer:
            'Currently, Domani is focused on individual productivity. We believe the evening planning method works best for personal task management. Team features may come in the future based on user feedback.',

      category: 'Pricing & Billing',
      questions: [
        {
          question: 'How is Domani cheaper than Sunsama?',
          answer:
            'Sunsama costs $20/month. Domani Premium is $3.99/monthâ€”that\'s 80% cheaper. We keep costs low by focusing on one thing (evening planning) instead of trying to be an all-in-one tool. Our Lifetime plan ($99) means you\'ll never pay a subscription again.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
          answer:
            'Yes! You can cancel your Premium subscription at any time. You\'ll keep access until the end of your billing period, then automatically revert to the Free plan. No penalties, no questions asked.',
        },
        {
          question: 'Is there a student discount?',
          answer:
            'We don\'t currently offer student discounts, but our Free tier is generous enough for most students. If you need more than 3 tasks per day, Premium at $3.99/month is already very affordable.',

          question: 'Where are you based?',

# Sunsama Alternative: Domani for Evening-First Planning

Sunsama helped lots of folks fall in love with daily planning, but it still expects you to rebuild everything the moment you wake up. Domani’s take is simpler: **plan at night, execute in the morning**, and keep your best energy for actually doing the work.

## Quick comparison

| Feature | Sunsama | Domani |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning window | Morning-first | Evening-first with plan lock |
| Task limit | Manual discipline | Built-in 3–6 task guardrails |
| Energy tagging | Basic | Energy-aware suggestions + streaks |
| Decision fatigue protection | None | Lock + reflection to prevent replanning |
| Pricing philosophy | Subscription only | Free core plan + premium + lifetime |

## Why evening-first wins

1. **You wrap the day while it’s fresh.** Move unfinished work with intent, not guilt.
2. **Sleep with a calmer brain.** Offload the spinning thoughts and fall asleep faster.
3. **Mornings become press play.** Open Domani and you’re already in “go” mode.

## Migration tips

- Import your Sunsama tasks via CSV straight into Domani’s capture inbox.
- Turn your favorite rituals (Workday Shutdown, Weekly Review) into Domani routines.
- Use the MIT guardrail to turn sprawling lists into three crisp commitments.
- Set the plan-lock reminder for 30 minutes before you usually log off.

## When Sunsama still makes sense

If your whole team lives inside a shared daily planner with kanban boards, Sunsama may still be the right vibe. Domani is for operators, founders, and ICs who just want calmer mornings without babysitting another complex tool.

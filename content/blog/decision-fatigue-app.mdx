# Decision Fatigue App Playbook: How Domani Removes Morning Overwhelm

Decision fatigue shows up quietly: doom-scrolling instead of shipping, cleaning your inbox before touching deep work, or rewriting the same list for the fourth time. You don’t need more willpower—you need to **decide everything tonight while your brain is relaxed**.

## Recognize the symptoms

- Planning is crammed into the exact morning you’re supposed to execute.
- Meetings cannibalize the creative work you swore you’d prioritize.
- Every notification feels urgent because nothing has been named “most important.”
- You end the day with context scattered across docs, notes, and sticky tabs.

## The Domani approach

1. **Evening capture.** Toss every open loop into Domani’s inbox so it’s waiting for you to sort, not remember.
2. **Three-task guardrail.** 3–6 well-defined tasks beat a dozen half-baked ones. Domani nudges you to keep it sane.
3. **Energy tags.** Label work by how much juice it needs and Domani suggests the best time of day.
4. **Plan lock + streaks.** Hit lock, go to bed, and wake up to a plan you’ve already agreed on (with streaks cheering you on).

## Micro automations that help

- **Calendar sync:** pulls meetings in so you aren’t planning in a vacuum.
- **Priority templates:** save your go-to labels (Work, Health, Personal) for 10-second task creation.
- **Reflection nudges:** two short questions each night keep the system honest.

## When to revisit the plan

Only when reality truly changes—a client fire drill, family emergency, or major shift. Otherwise trust last-night you. They weren’t rushing.

## The result

Open Domani at 6:30 a.m. and you’re greeted by fewer choices, tighter focus, and the confidence that the plan already passed yesterday’s vibe check. That’s how you beat decision fatigue without draining extra mental fuel.

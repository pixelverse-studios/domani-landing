# Evening Planning Routine: The Science of Waking Up Ready

Planning tomorrow when you’re relaxed feels a lot different than cramming it in between alarms and Slack pings. A gentle evening ritual takes the edge off **morning decision fatigue** and lets you wake up already knowing what “done” looks like.

## Why plan tomorrow tonight

- **No 7am scramble.** You already picked your Most Important Task (MIT) and where it lives on the calendar.
- **Clearer priorities.** With the day behind you it’s easier to see what mattered, what didn’t, and what should slide.
- **Less stress.** A calm brain makes better tradeoffs than a coffee-fueled one.
- **Easier sleep.** Jotting everything down tells your mind it can stop replaying to-dos.

## A friendly 4-step routine

1. **Look back.** Jot a quick win, a snag, and any loose context from the day.
2. **Pick 3 wins for tomorrow.** Domani’s MIT picker nudges you to keep it tight—anything past six tasks becomes wishful thinking.
3. **Match tasks to energy.** Give creative work the early slot and let admin stuff ride the afternoon.
4. **Lock it in.** No renegotiating with half-awake you in the morning.

> _Planning at night isn't about squeezing more work into your day. It's about reclaiming your mornings for execution instead of speculation._
